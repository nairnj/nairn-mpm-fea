NairnFEAMPMViz Plans
-------------------------------------------------------------------

¥ Remote execution
	Background submits (use submit commands instead of run, and no download)
		add exception until it is implemented
	Trap error returns and show error stream in window
	Download progress bar?

¥ When clip to particles in  mesh plot and zoom, it draws outside the view port

¥ Plot angle - add slider in the movie window before PS slider (do quantities work?)

¥ Control click plot for pop-up menu of plot options

¥ FEA Crack Closure Calculations

* BC plotting (both codes)
	Silent, heat flux, concentration flux, temperature, concentration
	
¥ Preferences
	Sub-element density in mesh plots
	Spectra inversion and brightness
	See NairnFEAMPM preferences for more
	Support setup of multiple servers

¥ Language
	Maintain library of subroutines to load
	Entity - Look for other commands to support its use
	Maintain library of material definitions
	See if NairnFEAMPM can allow same commands and assignments in materials
