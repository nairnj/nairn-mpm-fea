The files in this folder set up MPM calculations using the Mac application NairnFEAMPM (and may or may not run in NairnFEAMPMViz).

Best use of these files is to:

1. Copy file to a folder outside the project hierarchy
2. Open the copied file in NairnFEAMPM
3. Change any options in the files (as documented in comments)
4. Run the calculations

Comments at the beginning of each file define their purpose. Most of these files are basic simulations that might be useful in code development, especially when developing new materials.
