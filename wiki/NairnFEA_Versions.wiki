#summary NairnFEA Version History

= Introduction =

This page gives brief history of the main changes in various version of the `NairnFEA` code engine.

= Version in the Code =

The version number is coded in the constructor of the `NairnFEA.cpp` class:

{{{
	version=2;				// NairnFEA version number
	subversion=7;				// subversion number
	buildnumber=0;				// build number
}}}

= Version History =

NairnFEA was first imported to `GoogleCode.com` as version 2.7.0. The versions currently in this project are as follows:

  * OpenMP Branch - this branch was started on April 2, 2013 to make parallel code and is now temporary main development branch (the current trunk is listed below). FEA was done in August.
    * Working on NairnFEA 4.0.0
    * Aug 28: FEA uses parallel in matrix inversion.
    * Aug 30: Fixed FEA bug when using three stress to apply quadratic variation in stress.

  * Current trunk Version
    * Working on NairnFEA 3.0.0

  * Release-4.0 (9 JAN 2013)
    * Has NairnFEA 3.0.0
    * Allows `Body` and `Hole` commands to set elements with no material using shape commands.
    * A new `-w` option to map relative files relative to the working directory rather than the input file.
 
  * Release-3.0 (25 JAN 2012)
    * Has NairnFEA 2.9.0 
    * Converted to using Xerces 3.1.1 and must link to 3.x or newer because new Xerces is not compatible with Xerces 2.8 or older.
    * Converted all `longs` to `ints` to avoid any potential machine-dependent issues in 64 bit compiles (NairnFEA can compile as 32 bit or 64 bit, and must match Xerces library bits).
    * Added `Lagrange2D` element for 9 node quadrilateral (9th node in the center). It is integrated using 9 Gaussian points, because using less gave singular matrix in some simple problems.
    * Added `Entity` command.
    * Enhanced `BMP` command to allow specifying distance per pixel and to superpose multiple images.
    * Commands that specify materials with `mat` attribute can now use `matname` instead to specify materials by name. Using `mat` and `matname` options in the same input file should be avoided.

  * release-2.0 (25 JUL 2010)
    * Has NairnFEA 2.7.1
    * Added `<DevelFlag>` option in the `<Header>` for use in development coding.

  * release-1.0 (30 DEC 2009)
    * Has NairnFEA 2.7.0
    * Updated code to compile in GNU 4.3.1
    * Convert BMP file and angle file to fill elements in a mesh and remove unused elements and nodes
    * Requence finds connectivity issues and should be on when BMP is used

= Archival Version History =

Prior to being in `GoogleCode.com`, NairnMPM was in a local repository. That repository is available if needed. The prior versions are:
  
  * `NairnCode2_0_0` (4 NOV 2008)
    * Has NairnFEA 2.6.0
    * Fixed bug in new BMP commands when thermal stresses were used
    * Add y and z (axisymmetric) direction peridocity

  * `NairnCode1_5_0` (14 MAR 2008)
    * Has NairnFEA 2.5.0
    * Add methods from NairnMPM to interpret BMP files, but not yet used in FEA commands

  * `NairnCode1_4_0` (25 OCT 2007)
    * Has NairnFEA 2.4.0
    * User functions are now allowed to set properties as a function or x and y. They have been implemented in Temperature and Area (for angle) commands and in DisBC and LoadBC boundary conditions
    * Some material class reorganization such as printing to output window
    * Periodic in both x and y
    * New FEABoundaryCondition class as base class for all boundary conditions
    * CrackTip command to setup quarter point elements
  
  * `NairnCode1_3_0` (19 FEB 2007)
    * Has NairnFEA 2.3.0
    * No changes

  * `NairnCode1_2_0` (8 FEB 2007)
    * Has NairnFEA 2.2.0
    * Periodic BCs appear to be done, but for x direction only
  
  * `NairnCode1_1_0` (18 JAN 2007)
    * Has NairnFEA 2.1.0
    * Begnning of periodic boundary conditions, but not documented yet
    * Bug in anisotropic CTE with rotated material fixed

  * `NairnCode1_0_0` (22 DEC 2006)
    * Has NairnFEA 2.0.0
    * Code reorganized and NairnFEA and NairnMPM combined in single NairnCode

= Additional NairnFEA History =
