= Introduction =

This page gives brief history of the main changes in various version of the `NairnFEA` code engine.

= Version in the Code =

The version number is coded in the constructor of the `NairnFEA.cpp` class:

{{{
	version=2;				// NairnFEA version number
	subversion=7;				// subversion number
	buildnumber=0;				// build number
}}}

= Version History =

NairnFEA was first imported to `GoogleCode.com` as version 2.7.0. The versions currently in this project are as follows:

  * Current trunk Version
    * Working on NairnFEA 2.7.1
    * Added `<DevelFlag>` option in the `<Header>` for use in development coding.

  * release-1.0 (30 DEC 2009)
    * Has NairnFEA 2.7.0
    * Updated code to compile in GNU 4.3.1
    * Convert BMP file and angle file to fill elements in a mesh and remove unused elements and nodes
    * Requence finds connectivity issues and should be on when BMP is used

= Archival Version History =

Prior to being in `GoogleCode.com`, NairnMPM was in a local repository. That repository is available if needed. The prior versions are:
  
  * `NairnCode2_0_0` (4 NOV 2008)
    * Has NairnFEA 2.6.0
    * Fixed bug in new BMP commands when thermal stresses were used
    * Add y and z (axisymmetric) direction peridocity

  * `NairnCode1_5_0` (14 MAR 2008)
    * Has NairnFEA 2.5.0
    * Add methods from NairnMPM to interpret BMP files, but not yet used in FEA commands

  * `NairnCode1_4_0` (25 OCT 2007)
    * Has NairnFEA 2.4.0
    * User functions are now allowed to set properties as a function or x and y. They have been implemented in Temperature and Area (for angle) commands and in DisBC and LoadBC boundary conditions
    * Some material class reorganization such as printing to output window
    * Periodic in both x and y
    * New FEABoundaryCondition class as base class for all boundary conditions
    * CrackTip command to setup quarter point elements
  
  * `NairnCode1_3_0` (19 FEB 2007)
    * Has NairnFEA 2.3.0
    * No changes

  * `NairnCode1_2_0` (8 FEB 2007)
    * Has NairnFEA 2.2.0
    * Periodic BCs appear to be done, but for x direction only
  
  * `NairnCode1_1_0` (18 JAN 2007)
    * Has NairnFEA 2.1.0
    * Begnning of periodic boundary conditions, but not documented yet
    * Bug in anisotropic CTE with rotated material fixed

  * `NairnCode1_0_0` (22 DEC 2006)
    * Has NairnFEA 2.0.0
    * Code reorganized and NairnFEA and NairnMPM combined in single NairnCode

= Additional NairnFEA History =

The following versions are from a prior repository and are no longer available:

  * NairnFEA1_6_0 (14 FEB 2006) - based on NairnMPM5_1_0
    * Imperfect interfaces
    * Bug in 4-node AS with stress BC fixed
    * Code reoroganized. Main calc, reading, and archiving to objects

  * NairnFEA1_5_1 (15 JUL 2005) - based on NairnMPM5_0_2
    * FEA with keypoints, paths, and areas and BCs with them too
    * Resquence nodes
    * CST elements
    * Anisotropic Materials
    * Prints version number in output
    * Nearly done except interface elements, 1/4 pt elements, and temperature expressions

  * NairnFEA1_0_1 (15 JUL 2005) - unknown NairnMPM basis
    * Basic building blocks for keypoints, paths, and areas, but not use yet
    * Based on NairnMPM5_0_0
