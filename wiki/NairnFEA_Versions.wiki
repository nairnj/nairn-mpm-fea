A new repository was started in 2006. These are the versions available now

CurrentVersion
  Has NairnFEA 2.7.0
  Updated code to compile in GNU 4.3.1
  Convert BMP file and angle file to fill elements in a mesh and remove unused elements and nodes
  Requence finds connectivity issues and should be on when BMP is used

NairnCode2_0_0 (4 NOV 2008)
  Has NairnFEA 2.6.0
  Fixed bug in new BMP commands when thermal stresses were used
  Add y and z (axisymmetric) direction peridocity

NairnCode1_5_0 (14 MAR 2008)
  Has NairnFEA 2.5.0
  Add methods from NairnMPM to interpret BMP files, but not yet used in FEA commands

NairnCode1_4_0 (25 OCT 2007)
  Has NairnFEA 2.4.0
  User functions are now allowed to set properties as a function or x and y
    They have been implemented in Temperature and Area (for angle) commands
	and in DisBC and LoadBC boundary conditions
  Some material class reorganization such as printing to output window
  Periodic in both x and y
  New FEABoundaryCondition class as base class for all boundary conditions
  CrackTip command to setup quarter point elements

NairnCode1_3_0 (19 FEB 2007)
  Has NairnFEA 2.3.0
  No changes

NairnCode1_2_0 (8 FEB 2007)

  Begnning of periodic boundary conditions, but not documented yet
  Bug in anisotropic CTE with rotated material fixed
