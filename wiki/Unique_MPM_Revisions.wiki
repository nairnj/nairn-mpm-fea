= Introduction =

When the current code seems to be broken, it might be necessary to check out previous revisions to see what changed to cause the problem. This partial list has notes on certain key features put into various versions and on when source code was actually changes. Non-unique versions mean only comments or documentation was changed, but no source code was changed.
