= Introduction =

When the current code seems to be broken, it might be necessary to check out previous revisions to see what changed to cause the problem. This partial list has notes on certain key features put into various versions and on when source code was actually changed. Non-unique versions mean only comments or documentation was changed, but no source code was changed (or a change appear in several commits).


= Known Unique Revisions =

Revisions before the start of the table or after the end of table have not been checked. Revisions between any two numbers should be avoided when comparing to older code. Those revisions are either identical or might have a partial commit and should not be used.
