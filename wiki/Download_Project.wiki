= Introduction =

You can download the entire nairn-mpm-fea project from `google code` by using `Subversion` or `svn` on your local computer. This version control system is available for Mac and Linux as a command-line tool. In Windows, one solution is to set up `cygwin` and use its version of `svn` (see Windows_Setup). In each platform there may by other `svn` options as well.

Once you have `svn` you can either do an [See#Anonymous_Checkout] or a [See#Password_Enabled_Checkout].

#labels Anonymous Checkout,Password Enabled Checkout

= Anonymous Checkout =

For a public, anonymous checkout of `nairn-mpm-fea`, use the command line:

  `svn checkout http://nairn-mpm-fea.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ nairn-mpm-fea-read-only`

Here `nairn-mpm-fea-read-only` is the name of the folder that will be created with the checked out code. You can use any name you want.

Once you have the code, open the `index.html` file in the Documentation folder to learn how to compile all code, run calculations, and visualize the results.

= Password Enabled Checkout =

If you might want to contribute changes to the nairn-mpm-fea project, including changes to documentation or the project's wiki pages, or if you just want to have a visible presence in use of the code, you should checkout with a username and password. But first, you need a password. The process is:

  # Participating in any `googlecode.com` project requires a google account and a gmail email addess. If you do not have one, you can create one for free at <a href="http://www.google.com">`google.com`</a>. If you already have a google account, you can easily add an email address.
  # Email you google email address to &lt;John.Nairn@oregonstate.edu&gt; with a request to be a committer (ability to make changes) or a contributer (to be added as a visible user of the code). You will be emailed back when you have been added to the project.
  # Once you hear back sign in to your google account and find your profile in the `GoogleCode.com` section. The "My Profile" tab there will show you username and the "Settings" tab will show your `GoogleCode.com` password. Make of note of this generated password, because it is needed for checkout.

These above steps only need to be done once. Once there are done, you can use `svn` to check out a copy of the project with:

  `svn checkout https://nairn-mpm-fea.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ nairn-mpm-fea --username YOURUSERNAME`

Here `nairn-mpm-fea` is the name of the folder that will be created with the checked out code. You can use any name you want. Also `YOURUSERNAME` is the username you obtained in setp #3 above. After giving this command, you will need the password from step #3 to finish the checkout.
