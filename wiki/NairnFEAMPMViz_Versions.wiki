= Introduction =

This page give s brief history of the main changes in various version of the `NairnFEAMPMViz` Java application.

= Version in the Code =

The version number is code using a static variable for the `NairnFEAMPMViz` class:

{{{
public static final String versionReadable="Version 3.0.0";
}}}

= Version History =

NairnFEAMPMViz was first imported to `GoogleCode.com` as version 3.0.0. The versions currently in this project are as follows:

  * Current trunk Version
    * Working on NairnFEAMPMViz 3.2.0.
    * Reorganized the code moving all application details to a separate package.
    * Particle and mesh plots now have their own menu and can change the plot quantity.
    * Time and X-Y plots can add labels, which can be dragged to move and double clicked to edit.
    * Go To Line command for windows with commands.
    * Scale Results to plot mesh and particles with different units.
    * The Window menu tracks more windows.
    * On Mac, menus move to the top of the screen (but Mac users should use the Mac app instead)
    * Fixed on bug in mesh plots that clipped to particles.
    * Recent files menu
    * Can open 3D results. Can see text output, but only limited plotting options.
    * Updated to read FEA results with 9-node Lagrange elements

  * release-2.0 (25 JUL 2010)
    * Has NairnFEAMPMViz 3.1.0
    * Can zoom in on particle and mesh plots
    * MPM mesh plots can clip plot to the particles
    * Added menu command to export movie frames (MPM plots)
    * If change limits and click Replot, plot will now be redrawn with new limits (before had to change frame)
    * Added color wells for plot elements
    * Added purple to red spectrum
    * Synchronize time selected between plot and control panel for MPM plots

  * release-1.0 (30 DEC 2009)

    * Organized into windows with no button bar
    * Added dtd validation options
