= Introduction =

This page give s brief history of the main changes in various version of the `NairnFEAMPMViz` Java application.

= Version in the Code =

The version number is code using a static variable for the `NairnFEAMPMViz` class:

{{{
public static final String versionReadable="Version 3.0.0";
}}}

= Version History =

NairnFEAMPMViz was first imported to `GoogleCode.com` as version 3.0.0. The versions currently in this project are as follows:

  * OpenMP Branch - this branch started to make parallel code. It is the current main branch (main trunk sill listed below). This Java app is added extensive support for scripted files instead of only editing XML files
    * Working on NairnFEAMPMViz 5.0.
    * XML and script command to launch parallel calculations
    * FEA script commands complete (except for BMPRegion)

  * Current trunk Version
    * Working on NairnFEAMPMViz 4.0.

  * release-4.0 (9 JAN 2013)
    * Has NairnFEAMPMViz 4.0.
    * Update to handle the new axisymmetric MPM option in NairnMPM.
    * Started a scripting language similar to NairnFEAMPM (Mac app), which is a much better way to create models than using direct `XML` commands. Most of the FEA commands and some of the MPM commands are done. The scripting language itself is modeled on the NairnFEAMPM language, but still lacks some features of that language. What is present is mostly compatible.
    * Enhanced help window to document new scripting commands and all material types.
    * Continuous development of the user interface.

  * release-3.0 (25 JAN 2012)
    * Has NairnFEAMPMViz 3.3.0.
    * Reorganized the code moving all application details to a separate package.
    * Particle and mesh plots now have their own menu and can change the plot quantity.
    * Time and X-Y plots can add labels, which can be dragged to move and double clicked to edit.
    * Go To Line command for windows with commands.
    * Scale Results to plot mesh and particles with different units.
    * The Window menu tracks more windows.
    * On Mac, menus move to the top of the screen (but Mac users should use the Mac app instead)
    * Fixed one bug in mesh plots that clipped to particles.
    * Recent files menu
    * Can open 3D results. Can see text output, but only limited plotting options.
    * Updated to read FEA results with 9-node Lagrange elements
    * Find/Replace window for editing of input files or for finding in analysis results.

  * release-2.0 (25 JUL 2010)
    * Has NairnFEAMPMViz 3.1.0
    * Can zoom in on particle and mesh plots
    * MPM mesh plots can clip plot to the particles
    * Added menu command to export movie frames (MPM plots)
    * If change limits and click Replot, plot will now be redrawn with new limits (before had to change frame)
    * Added color wells for plot elements
    * Added purple to red spectrum
    * Synchronize time selected between plot and control panel for MPM plots

  * release-1.0 (30 DEC 2009)
    * Has NairnFEAMPMViz 3.0.0
    * Organized into windows with no button bar
    * Added dtd validation options
    * Icon tool bars
    * Two new color options for plots and discrete spectra option
