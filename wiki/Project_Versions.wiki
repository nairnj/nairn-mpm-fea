#summary List of available versions for check out

= Introduction =

The main `trunk` of the project contains the working code; a [Download_Project standard check out] gets this version. Since this code is computational mechanics research software, the main `trunk` may occasionally have issues or incomplete features. To help avoid such issues, various complete releases are `tagged` and can be checked out instead while waiting for main `trunk` to reach a stable condition.

=Nairn-MPM-FEA Tagged Releases=

==Checking Out a Tagged Version==

To check out a tagged release instead of the current development release, simply change the path in the checkout command. For example, an anonymous check out would be

{{{
svn checkout http://nairn-mpm-fea.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release-1.0 nairn-mpm-fea-1.0
}}}

where the final component in the path is the version you want. See [#Tagged_Versions below] for a list of available tagged versions.

==Tagging a Version by Committers==

When the current main `trunk` is stable, you can store a tagged version with the command

{{{
svn copy https://nairn-mpm-fea.googlecode.com/svn/trunk \
      https://nairn-mpm-fea.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release-2.2 \
      -m "Tagging stable release 2.2"
}}}

where you enter any unused release number.
