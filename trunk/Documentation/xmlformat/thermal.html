<h1>Thermal Conduction and Loading</h1>

<p>NairnMPM can do coupled elasticity-thermal conductivity calculations or can apply a constant temperature difference to all particles and calculate the resulting thermal stresses. Thermal conductivity and constant temperature differences can be combined becuase a constant (or isothermal) temperature distribution dues not result in any gradients or any conduction. The following approach to thermal calculations is for NairnMPM only; thermal loading in NairnFEA is applied with a different command. The key temperature is relative to the stress free temperature. This temperature can be set in the <a href="mpmheader.html#stressfreetemp">MPM header block</a> (it is set to zero by default).</p>

<p>The format for setting up thermal calculations is:</p>

<pre>
&lt;Thermal&gt;
  &lt;Conduction/&gt;
  &lt;CrackTipHeating/&gt;
  &lt;EnergyCoupling/&gt;
  &lt;Isothermal time="5" start="2"&gt;-200&lt;/Isothermal&gt;
&lt;/Thermal&gt;
</pre>

<p>where</p>

<dl>

<dt>&lt;Conduction/&gt;</dt>
<dd>This tag specifies that the calculation should do coupled thermal conduction analysis.
</dd>

<dt>&lt;CrackTipHeating/&gt;</dt>
<dd>This tag will cause energy released by crack growth to be released as a heat source into a conduction analysis. This command has no affect unless the <code>&lt;Conduction/&gt;</code> tag is present which means the analysis will be doing coupled thermal conduction calculations. When using this command, you must be sure to s<a href="cracks.html">et the crack thickness</a> to the appropriate value. Currently 100% of the fracture energy is converted to heat (there may be an option in the future to control the fraction of energy released as heat).
</dd>

<dt>&lt;EnergyCoupling/&gt;</dt>
<dd>This tag will cause energy dissipated by a <a href="definematl.html">material's</a> constitutive low to be converted to a heat source that will increase temperature. This is implemented for all plastic materials (e.g., <a href="definematl.html#isoplast">Isotropic Elastic-Plastic</a>, <a href="definematl.html#hill">Hill plastic</a>, <a href="definematl.html#MGEOS">MGEOS</a>, <i>etc.</i>). This option can be used with or without conduction. When there is no conduction, all temperature rise will remain on the particle.
</dd>

<dt>&lt;Isothermal&gt;</dt>
<dd>This tag specifies the constant temperature difference to apply to each particle. It is expressed as the difference between the stress free temperature and the isothermal temperature in degrees Celsius. The optional <code>time</code> attribute allows the simulation to ramp the temperature difference from zero to the difference supplied in the <code>&lt;Isothermal&gt;</code> value of any time span. Enter the total time (in ms) to reach the final temperature difference. The optional <code>start</code> attribute allows the ramp to start at any time (in ms); if not supplied, the ramp will start at time zero.
</dd>

<p>Note that rather than ramping up an isothermal temperature change, it is also possible to instantaneous supply a temperature to all particles at the start of the calculations. An instantaneous temperature can be applied either by using an <code>Isothermal</code> command with the ramp time less than zero (or omitted) and by specifiying particle temperature with a <code>temp</code> attribute when <a href="definempm.html">creating material points</a>. An instantaneous temperature change is analogous to impact loading and may cause stress and strain oscillations. It is usually better to ramp up particle temperature difference.
