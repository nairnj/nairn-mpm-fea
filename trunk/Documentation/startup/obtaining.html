<h1>Obtaining MPM and FEA Source Code</h1>

<p>
The source code for the <code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code> calculation engines and for the <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b> java application are publically available. As of December 2009, the code has be commited to a <code>googlecode</code> project called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nairn-mpm-fea/"><code>nairn-mpm-fea</code></a>. You can obtain code from this project one of two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#anon">Anonymous checkout for anyone</a></li>
<li><a href="#secure">Secured check with ability to make changes</a></li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="anon"></a>Anonymous Checkout</h1>

<p>The <code>googlecode</code> project is publically available for anyone to checkout anonymously. First, you need a work station with <code>svn</code> or the subversion system used by <code>googlecode</code>. Versions of <code>svn</code> are available for Mac, Windows, and Linux. Once you have <code>svn</code> installed, you check out the code as follows:
</p>

<pre>
svn checkout http://nairn-mpm-fea.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ nairn-mpm-fea-read-only
</pre>

<p>Here <code>nairn-mpm-fea-read-only</code> is the name of the folder that will be created with the checked out code. You can use any name you want.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="organize.html">source code files</a> for information on the contents of the checked out code. The above checkout out will get the current version of the code. See <a href="versions.html">version history</a> to read about other versions and to learn how to get those versions instead.
</p>

<h1><a name="secure"></a>Secured Checkout</h1>

<p>If you might want to contribute changes to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nairn-mpm-fea/"><code>nairn-mpm-fea</code></a> project, including changes to documentation or the project's <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nairn-mpm-fea/w/list">wiki pages</a>, or if you just want a visible presence in use of the code, you should checkout with a username and password. But first, you need a password. The process is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Participating in a <code>googlecode</code> project requires a <code>google</code> or <code>gmail</code> account. If you do not have one, you can create one for free at <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>. If you already have a <code>google</code> account, you can easily add an email address.</li>
<li>Email you <code>google</code> email address to <a href="mailto:John.Nairn@oregonstate.edu">John.Nairn@oregonstate.edu</a> with a request to the a committer (ability to make changes) or a contributer (to be added as a visible user of the code). You will be emailed back when you have been added to the project</li>
<li>Sign in to your <a href="http://code.google.com/">google account</a> and find your profile in the <code>google code</code> section. The &quot;My Profile&quot; tab will show you user name and the &quot;Settings&quot; tab will show the <code>GoogleCode.com</code> password. Make of note of the password, because it is needed for checkout</li>
<li>Finally, you need <code>svn</code> installed on your computer. Versions of <code>svn</code> are available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.
</ol>

<p>Once the above steps are down (and they only need to be done once), you can check out the code with:</p>

<pre>
svn checkout https://nairn-mpm-fea.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ nairn-mpm-fea --username YOURUSERNAME
</pre>

<p>Here <code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> is the name of the folder that will be created with the checked out code. You can use any name you want. Also <code>YOURUSERNAME</code> is the username you obtained in setp #3 above. After giving this command, you will need the password from step #3 to finish the checkout
</p>

<p>
See <a href="organize.html">source code files</a> for information on the contents of the checked out code. The above checkout out will get the current version of the code. See <a href="versions.html">version history</a> to read about other versions and to learn how to get those versions instead.
