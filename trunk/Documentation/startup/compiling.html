<h1><a name="top"></a>Compiling NairnMPM and NairnFEA Source Code</h1>

<p>After <a href="obtaining.html">downloading source code</a>, the next step is to compile it. All code-engine source code is standard <code>C++</code>  and it should be possible to compile on a variety of systems. This page gives details on some common systems. Users are responsible for compilation on other systems.</p>

<a name="xcode"></a><h1>MacOS X</h1>

<h2>XCode Compilation
</h2>

<p>Most development of <code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code> is done in MacOS X and thus compiling on MacOS X is easy. The preferred method is to use XCode (a <a href="#term">command-line method</a> is described below). A complete XCode project is located at</p>

<pre>
NairnCode/Common/Projects/NairnMPM.xcodeproj
</pre>

<p>This project is called <code>NairnMPM</code>, but it includes all MPM and FEA source code in two targets named <code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code>. Select the desired target and use build command to compile the code.
</p>

<a name="xerces"></a><p>Before the code will compile and run, you will need an installed version of the <code>Xerces</code> library and a copy of the <code>Xerces</code> header files. The XCode project assumes they are installed in the default locations for MacOS X or at</P>

<pre>
/usr/local/lib/libxerces-c.dylib
</pre>

<p>for the library and at<p>

<pre>
/usr/local/include
</pre>

<p>for the header files. If you download and install the <a href="http://oregonstate.edu/~nairnj/NairnFEAMPM/index.html">NairnFEAMPM</a> package, it will install the <code>xerces</code> library (as a universal binary for all Macs) for you, but you will still need the header files. These can be obtained by downloading the 
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html"><code>xerces</code> source code</a> from the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a> web site. You can either move the header files to <code>/usr/local/include</code> or add the root <code>xerces</code> source folder you downloaded to the header search paths by editing the active target using the Project menu (you have to add it to both the <code>NairnFEA</code> and the <code>NairnMPM</code> targets).
</p>

<p>Once the code is compiled, do a <a href="../running/index.html">test run</a> to verify it worked.
</p>

<h2><a name="term"></a>MacOS X Command-Line Compilation</h2>

<p>It is also easy to compile on MacOS X using a command line approach. First install <code>xerces</code> and its header files as <a href="#xerces">explained above</a> and make sure they are in the specified default locations.

<p>Once the variables are set, you compile <code>NairnMPM</code> using:</p>

<pre>
cd NairnCode/NairnMPM/build
make SYSTEM=mac
</pre>

<p>and compile <code>NairnFEA</code> using:</p>

<pre>
cd NairnCode/NairnFEA/build
make SYSTEM=mac
</pre>

<p>All source code will be compiled and the executables will be installed in <code>NairnCode/NairnMPM/input</code> or <code>NairnCode/NairnFEA/input</code>, respectively. You can use an additional '<code>make install</code>' command to copy each compiled executable to your <code>~/bin</code> folder if desired.
</p>

<p>If the command-line compile does not work, the most likely explanation is a problem with the <code>xerces</code> installation. You either have to install it as specified <a href="#xerces">above</a> or edit the <code>makefile</code> to recognize your custom installation. The process is documented in the <code>makefile</code> and involves editing the <code>xercesSo</code> and <code>headersPath</code> variables for your different settings.
</p>

<p>Once the code is compiled, do a <a href="../running/index.html">test run</a> to verify it worked.
</p>

<a name="windows"></a><h1>Windows Using cygwin</h1>

<p>To compile and run in Windows, you need some kind of Linux/Unix environment. The recommended option is to use <a href="http://www.cygwin.com"><code>cygwin</code></a> and this documentation is based on its use. This process has be verified in both Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 (although you may need the latest <code>cygwin</code> 1.7 for Windows 7). The step-by-step process is:
<p>

<ol>

<li>Download the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">cygwin setup.exe</a> application and run it (to install <code>cygwin</code> or to install plug-ins needed below, if you already have <code>cygwin</code> installed).
</li>

<li>Follow the default options until you reach the &quot;Packages&quot; step of the Cygwin Setup wizard. In that step, expand the &quot;Devel&quot; category and select:
<ul class="lev2">
<li><code>cvs</code> - the cvs command for downloading code (optional, but needed if code will be obtained by <code>cvs</code>)
<li><code>g++</code> - the gnu c++ compiler
<li><code>gdb</code> - the gnu debugger (optional)
<li><code>make</code> - program for making files (the <code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code> binaries)
</ul>

Next, expand the &quot;Net&quot; category and select:
<ul class="lev2">
<li><code>openssh</code> - ssh command for secure remote connections (optional, but needed if code will be obtained by <code>cvs</code>).
</ul>

Finally, if you would like a command-line editor, you can optionally expand the &quot;Editors&quot; section and select the one you want (<i>e.g.</i>, <code>vim</code>). Similarly, you can select any other packages in any section that interests you. You can also return to this setup and select them later.
</li>

<li><code>Cygwin</code> has an option to install the <code>xerces</code> binary, but usually has an out-dated version of <code>xerces</code>. The preferred approach is to download the <code>xerces</code> source code for a newer version (2.7.0 or newer), build it, and install it. The procedure is:
<ol class="alpha">
<li><a href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/download.cgi">Download the <code>xerces</code> source code</a>, which will be in a file such as <code>xerces-c-src_2_8_0.tar.gz</code>. Note that you should get the <code>.tar.gz</code> file instead of the <code>.zip</code> version because the <code>.zip</code> version has DOS files with carriage returns and line feeds (either in the source or inserted by Windows' zip methods) that complicate compiliation. The <code>.tar.gz</code> file is also smaller. Also note that <code>NairnCode</code> and the following instructions have been tested with <code>xerces</code> 2.6 through 2.8. A new <code>xerces</code> 3.0 has recently appeared. While it is likely the lastest version would work fine, it has not been tested and the method to build the source code has changed. Consult the <a href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/build-3.html"><code>xerces</code> intructions</a> if you want to proceed with version 3.0 (note that version 2.8 can still be downloaded).</li>

<li>Move the downloaded file to the <code>cygwin</code> root directory. By default, the <code>cygwin</code> directory is installed at <code>C:\cygwin</code>. Start a <code>cygwin</code> shell and and extract the files with:
<pre>
cd /
gunzip xerces-c-src_2_8_0.tar.gz
tar xvf xerces-c-src_2_8_0.tar
</pre>

<li>Set the <code>XERCESCROOT</code> variable in a <code>cygwin</code> bash shell to the newly extracted folder using
<pre>
export XERCESCROOT=/xerces-c-src_2_8_0
</pre>

<li>Go to the <code>/xerces-c-src_2_8_0/src/xercesc</code> folder and enter the command
<pre>
./runConfigure -pcygwin -cgcc -xg++
</pre>
This step will prepare the <code>xerces</code> source code for building. Note: if you get error messages saying that $'\r'$ command is not found it means your files are DOS files rather than Unix files. Consult a Unix expert on how to fix them or go back to step <code>a</code> and get the <code>.tar.gz</code> file this time.

<li>When this configuring step is done, enter the command &quot;<code>make</code>&quot; in the same folder. This step will compile <code>xerces</code>.

<li>Finally, enter the command &quot;<code>make install</code>&quot; (still in the same folder). This step will install the compiled <code>xerces</code> libraries and needed header files in the default locations in the <code>/usr/local</code> folder.

</ol>
</li>

<li><a href="obtaining.html">Get/checkout the NairnCode source code folder</a> into your your home directory in the cygwin environment (located by default at <code>C:\cygwin\home\UserName</code> but may be elsewhere). The <code>cygwin</code> path to the first home folder is <code>/home/UserName</code>. The <code>cygwin</code> path to your Windows home folder is <code>/cygdrive/c/Users/UserName</code>.
</li>

<li>Finally, you compile <code>NairnMPM</code> using:</p>

<pre>
cd NairnCode/NairnMPM/build
make SYSTEM=cygwin
</pre>

<p>and compile <code>NairnFEA</code> using:</p>

<pre>
cd NairnCode/NairnFEA/build
make SYSTEM=cygwin
</pre>

<p>All source code will be compiled and the executables will be installed in <code>NairnCode/NairnMPM/input</code> or <code>NairnCode/NairnFEA/input</code>, respectively. You can use an additional '<code>make install</code>' command to copy each compiled executable to your <code>~/bin</code> folder if desired.
</p>

<p>If the command-line compile does not work, the most likely explanation is a problem with the <code>xerces</code> installation. You either have to install it as specified above or edit the <code>makefile</code> to recognize your custom installation. The process is documented in the <code>makefile</code> and involves editing the <code>xercesSo</code> and <code>headersPath</code> variables for your different settings.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>Once the code is compiled, do a <a href="../running/index.html">test run</a> to verify it worked.
</p>

<a name="eclipse"></a><h1>Compile using Eclipse IDE</h1>

<p>Working with source code is easier when done using an integrated development environment (IDE) rather than using basic text editing on a collection of source files. On MacOS X, you can use the XCode IDE (free with developer tools) and the NairnCode download has an <a href="#xcode">XCode project ready to use</a>. An option for any other platform (and for MacOS X too) is to use the cross-platform IDE <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a>, which is an open-source and free IDE. This section explains how to compile <code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code> using <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a>. Experienced Eclipse users may have better methods, but the steps explained below should work.
<p>

<p>The first steps are to install and prepare Eclipse for C/C++ development as follows:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Before using <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a> on a new platform, you should <a href="obtaining.html">download NairnCode</a> and get it compiled using command line methods for your platform. This task verifies that you have the <code>xerces</code> library correctly installed, that the <code>makefile</code>s are valid to your system, and, for Windows, that <a href="#windows">cygwin is correctly installed</a>. All these items are prerequisites to successful compilation using <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a>.
</li>

<li>Download and install <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a>. As downloaded, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a> may only be set up for Java development, and not ready for C/C++ development (depending on what you download). To configure for C/C++ development, choose the menu command &quot;Help &rarr; Software Update &rarr; Find and Install...&quot; and follow the procedures to install the C/C++ Development Tools (or CDT)
</li>

<li>In Windows, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a> uses some <code>cygwin</code> tools and therefore projects need to know the path to the cygwin/bin folder. Thus, before creating any projects:
<ol class="alpha">
<li>Choose menu command to open Eclipse preferences
<li>Find section for C/C++ &rarr; Make &rarr; New Make Projects
<li>In the &quot;Environment&quot; section add the variable <code>PATH</code> with value <code>;C:\cygwin\bin;</code> (<i>i.e.</i>, the path to the bin direcetory of your cygwin folder). Make sure the option to append to native environment is selected.
<li>Click OK
</ol>
No such setting is required in MacOS X because, if developer tools are installed, it is automatically set up for compiling with Eclipse. On other plaftorms, some setting may be needed for Eclipse to locate all the required tools.
</ol>

<p>The above steps only need to be done the first time you compile <code>NairnMPM</code> and/or <code>NairnFEA</code>. Once there are done, you can proceed creating <code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code> projects as follows. These steps explain both at once. You can do both or just the one you need.
</p>

<ol>

<li>Create a new project and select a C/C++ standard make file project. Name it &quot;NairnMPM&quot; and click Finish. Repeat (if desired) to create a &quot;NairnFEA&quot; project.
</li>

<li>Select the NairnMPM project and create two new source folders - one called <code>src</code> and the other called <code>Common</code>. Repeat for NairnFEA project, but create just a <code>src</code> folder. <b>Note</b>: if you are compiling only <code>NairnFEA</code>, create a <code>Common</code> source folder in NairnFEA project too, otherwise that project will use the common files in the NairnMPM project.
</li>

<li>Right click (control click in MacOS X) on the <code>src</code> folder in the NairnMPM project and choose Import. Select General &rarr; File System and then browse for the <code>NairnCode/NairnMPM/src</code> folder in your <a href="obtaining.html">downloaded NairnCode folder</a>. After selecting the folder, check its box in the left half of the window and click Finish. Repeat for NairnFEA project, but import the <code>NairnCode/NairnFEA/src</code> folder into its <code>src</code> folder.
</li>

<li>Right click (control click in MacOS X) on the <code>Common</code> folder in the NairnMPM project and choose Import. Select General &rarr; File System and then browse for the <code>NairnCode/Common</code> folder in your <a href="obtaining.html">downloaded NairnCode folder</a>. After selecting the folder, check its box on the left half of the window. Next expand the folder deselect the <code>Projects</code> folder and click Finish. If you are compiling only <code>NairnFEA</code>, do the above step for a <code>Common</code> folder in that project, otherwise nothing else is needed in this step for the NairnFEA project.
</li>

<li>Select the NairnMPM project and create two new folders (not source folders) - one called <code>input</code> and the other called <code>build</code>. Repeat for NairnFEA project.
</li>

<li>Right click (control click in MacOS X) on the <code>build</code> folder in the NairnMPM project and choose Import. Select General &rarr; File System and then browse for the <code>NairnCode/NairnMPM/build</code> folder in your <a href="obtaining.html">downloaded NairnCode folder</a>. After selecting the folder, check its box on the left half of the window and then select the folder. On the right half of the window, select only the <code>makefile</code>. Click Finish. Repeat for NairnFEA project, but import the <code>makefile</code> in <code>NairnCode/NairnFEA/build</code>.
</li>

<li>Right click (control click in MacOS X) on the <code>input</code> folder in the NairnMPM project and choose Import. Select General &rarr; File System and then browse for the <code>NairnCode/NairnMPM/input</code> folder in your <a href="obtaining.html">downloaded NairnCode folder</a>. After selecting the folder, check its box on the left half of the window and then select the folder. On the right half of the window, select only the <code>NairnMPM.dtd</code> file. Click Finish. Repeat for NairnFEA project, but import the <code>NairnFEA.dtd</code> file in <code>NairnCode/NairnFEA/input</code>.
</li>

<li>Open the NairnMPM project properties. In the C/C++ make project settings or build settings, set the building directory to the <code>NairnMPM/build</code> folder. Repeat for NairnFEA project, setting the build folder to the <code>NairnFEA/build</code> folder. In that same window, change the <code>make</code> command from the default settings for NairnMPM to:
<ol class="alpha">
<li>For Windows/cygwin, change it to &quot;<code>make SYSTEM=cygwin CC=/bin/g++ RM=/bin/rm com=../Common</code>&quot;
<li>For Mac, change it to &quot;<code>make SYSTEM=mac com=../Common</code>&quot;
<li>For Linux, change it to &quot;<code>make com=../Common</code>&quot; (but this is untested).
</ol>
For the NairnFEA project, change the <code>make</code> command from the default settings to:
<ol class="alpha">
<li>For Windows/cygwin, change it to &quot;<code>make SYSTEM=cygwin CC=/bin/g++ RM=/bin/rm com=../../NairnMPM/Common</code>&quot;
<li>For Mac, change it to &quot;<code>make SYSTEM=mac com=../../NairnMPM/Common</code>&quot;
<li>For Linux, change it to &quot;<code>make com=../../NairnMPM/Common</code>&quot; (but this is untested).
</ol>
<b>Note:</b> If you only created the NairnFEA project and put the <code>Common</code> folder in that project, use <code>com=../Common</code> for each of these settings instead.
</li>

<li>If everything worked, you should be able to build the project by selecting the project and choosing &quot;Build Project&quot; menu command. If automatic building is selected, the project may have already been built (although due to project size is is better to turn off automatic building). When done, it will install <code>NairnMPM</code> or <code>NairnFEA</code> executables into the input folders for those projects.
</li>

<li>If building did not work due to a command or target error, you may need to change the <code>make</code> command settings in step 8 or alternatively edit the <code>makefile</code>.
</li>

<li>If the initial projects had some dummy files (such as an initial <code>makefile</code> or source code for a trivial <code>main()</code>), you can delete those files. You should keep all project info files (files with names beginning in dot).

</ol>

<p>You can now edit source code as desired and rebuild the project. This project is a manual <code>makefile</code> project. If you add new source code, or change the dependencies of source code on header files, you will need to edit the <code>makefile</code> to reflect those changes.
</p>

<p>Each time you build, you will get new versions of <code>NairnMPM</code> or <code>NairnFEA</code>. There is nothing to run in Eclipse. The next task, is thus to decide how to run the new executables. There are various options:
</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are using MacOS X and the <a href="http://oregonstate.edu/~nairnj/NairnFEAMPM/index.html">NairnFEAMPM package</a>, simply set the code and dtd paths to the files in the input folders in your Eclipse workspace (see <a href="../running/index.html#macosx">running code help</a> for details).
</li>

<li>On other platforms, you will be <a href="../running/index.html#runFEA">running the code using command-line methods</a>. The main task is to access the new executable. Some options are:
<ul class="lev2">
<li>Add the paths to your input folders in the Eclipse workspace to your <code>$PATH</code> variable in your login file. You can then run the code with just <a href="../running/index.html"><code>NairnMPM</code> or <code>NairnFEA</code> commands</a>.
</li>

<li>Copy the executables to one folder in your home directory (such as a <code>~/bin</code> folder) and add just that folder to your $<code>PATH</code> variable.

<li>Configure your <code>makefiles</code> to write the executables to a folder in your home directory. For example, to write the files directly to a <code>~/bin</code> folder, edit the <code>makefile</code> for the NairnMPM or NairnFEA project and change the variable <code>output</code>  to be &quot;<code>output = ~/bin/NairnMPM</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>output = ~/bin/NairnFEA</code>&quot;.
</li>

</ul>
</ul>

<p>When you <a href="obtaining.html">download a new version NairnCode</a>, you do not need to start over. You can update simply by repeating steps 3, 4, 6, and 7 (<b>warning</b>: this update will erase any source code changes you made; if you want to keep them, you should create a new project instead or backup your old files first). The project should then be ready to build and run.</p>

<p>
</p>
<a name="linux"></a><h1>Specific Linux Systems</h1>

<p>The code can easily be compiled on any Linux system with a c++ compiler and with <code>xerces</code> already installed. Below are details on specific systems that are already set up for compilation and are currently in use for <code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code>. See the section on <a href="#other">other systems</a> for compilation on other Linux/Unix systems.
</p>

<p>On the following specific Linux systems, the source code is set up for easy compilation and <code>xerces</code> is already installed. All you need to do is you the proper variable argument in the <code>make</code> command. The details are:

<a name="carbon"></a><h2>Carbon/Hedera Cluster (Oregon State University)</h2>

<p>If you are using the Carbon/Hedera cluster in the <a href="http://www.oregonstate.edu/">Oregon State University</a>, <a href="http://woodscience.oregonstate.edu//">Wood Science &amp; Engineering Department</a>, use a simple make command.

<h2><a name="cdmake"></a>Compilation on All Above Linux Systems
</h2>

<p>The commands for the above system will compile all source code and install the executables in <code>NairnCode/NairnMPM/input</code> or <code>NairnCode/NairnFEA/input</code>, respectively. Once the code is compiled, do a <a href="../running/index.html">test run</a> to verify it worked.
</p>

<a name="other"></a><h1>Other Systems</h1>

<p>Compiling on any Linux/Unix system should be straightforward, with the most difficult step usually being installing and linking to the <code>xerces</code> library. The key steps needed for successful compilation:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a compatible <code>C++</code> compiler. The code is known to work with <code>gcc 3.2</code> or newer (most current development is using <code>gcc 4.0</code>). It is possible other compilers will need minor changes for compilation.</li>

<li>Validation and parsing of the <code>XML</code> files are handled using free third party software from the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a> called the
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html"><code>xerces</code> validating XML parser</a>. You will need to download <code>xerces</code> and install it on your system. It is available in <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/install.html">binary installs</a> for some systems (<i>e.g.</i>, Linux and Windows). For others systems (<i>e.g.</i>, MacOS X) you need to download the source code and <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/build.html">build</a> it. When <a href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-c/stable/">downloading</a> <code>xerces</code> source code, look for the file <code>xerces-c-srcvvv.tar.gz</code> where <code>vvv</code> is the <code>xerces</code> version number. When <a href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-c/stable/">downloading</a> in binary form, look for <code>xerces-cvvv-xxx.tar.gz</code> where <code>xxx</code> is the system name. <code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code> are currently being developed with <code>xerces 2.8.0</code>. It should work with <code>xerces 2.3.0</code> or newer.
</li>

<li>Compiling of <code>NairnMPM</code> or <code>NairnFEA</code> needs access to all the <code>xerces</code> header files. These are provided in the <code>xerces</code> source code downloads. If your system has the xerces binary installed, it may not have the header files. You can get them by  <a href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-c/stable/">downloading the xerces source code</a>, even though you will not need to build it.</li>

</ol>

<p>Once a suitable compiler, the <code>xerces</code> binary, and <code>xerces</code> header files are installed, compilation may require editing the <code>makefile</code>s in the NairnCode folders. Specifically, you will need to edit the <code>makefile</code>s in the <code>build</code> directories (<code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code>) and set the following variables:

<ol>
<li>The variable <code>CC</code>: set it to the desired <code>C++</code> compiler.</li>
<li>The variable <code>xercesSo</code>: set it to the path name to the <code>xerces</code> library binary file.</li>
<li>The variable <code>headersPath</code>: set it to the path name to the folder containing the <code>xercesc</code> folder of header files.</li>
</ol>

<p>After setting the variables, use a standard <code>make</code> command to compile the code.
Once the code is compiled, do a <a href="../running/index.html">test run</a> to verify it worked.
</p>

<p>If you successfully get the code compiled and running on a system that is not listed above, please send email to <a href="mailto:John.Nairn@oregonstate.edu">John.Nairn@oregonstate.edu</a> with the system name and step-by-step instructions for compiling and running the code.</p>
