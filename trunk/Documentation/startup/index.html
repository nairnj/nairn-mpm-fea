<h1><a name="top"></a>Compiling NairnMPM and NairnFEA Source Code</h1>

<p>After checking out the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nairn-mpm-fea/"><code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> project</a>, the next step is to compile it. All code-engine source code is standard <code>C++</code>  and it should be possible to compile on a variety of systems. This page gives details on some common systems. Users are responsible for compilation on other systems.</p>

<a name="xcode"></a><h1>MacOS X</h1>

<h2>XCode Compilation
</h2>

<p>Most development of <code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code> is done in MacOS X and thus compiling on MacOS X is easy. The preferred method is to use XCode (a <a href="#term">command-line method</a> is described below). A complete XCode project is located at</p>

<pre>
nairn-mpm-fea/Common/Projects/NairnMPM.xcodeproj
</pre>

<p>This project is called <code>NairnMPM</code>, but it includes all MPM and FEA source code in two targets named <code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code>.
</p>

<p><a name="xerces"></a>Before you can compile and run the project, however, you will need an installed version  of the <code>xerces</code> library and a copy of the <code>xerces</code> header files. The XCode project assumes they are installed in the default locations for MacOS X or at</>

<pre>
/usr/local/lib/libxerces-c.dylib
</pre>

<p>for the library and at</p>

<pre>
/usr/local/include
</pre>

<p>for the header files. These can be changed if needed by editing the project and target settings. Since revision 274 of the <code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> project, this library must be <code>xerces 3.0</code> or newer; prior to that revision, it had be <code>xerces 2.8</code> or older. These libraries can be obtained by downloading the 
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html"><code>xerces</code> source code</a> from the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a> web site and then building and installing <code>xerces</code> with the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open Terminal app and navigate to the xerces source folder expanded from the downloaded file.</li>
<li>Configure the code with the command:
<pre>
./configure CFLAGS="-arch x86_64" CXXFLAGS="-arch x86_64"</pre>
where the provided <code>arch</code> (or architecture) is the desired option for your machine. The main Mac options are <code>i386</code> for 32 bit Intel processors, <code>x86_64</code> for 64 bit Intel processors,  <code>ppc</code> for 32 bit PowerPC chips, or <code>ppc64</code> for 64 bit PowerPC64 chips. The PowerPC versions are no longer tested, but should work. Although <code>i386</code> will work on any Intel processor, you should use <code>x86_64</code> if you have a 64 bit processor, because the code will run faster. To determine how many bits your Intel chip has, chose &quot;About This Mac&quot; from the Apple menu, click &quot;More Info...&quot; button, and look up the processor name in the hardware section. The &quot;Intel Core Solo&quot; and &quot;Intel Core Duo&quot; are 32 bit chips and most others are 64 bit chips.
</li>
<li>When the configuration is done, use the following commands:
<pre>
cd src
make
make install</pre>
These command make the library (but not the unneeded <code>xerces</code> examples). The final install command after <code>make</code> is done, installs the both the library and the header files at the default locations listed above.</li>
<li>When working with <code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> on a new Mac, the <code>xerces</code> installation only needs to be done once. The only reason to repeat it is when a new <code>xerces</code> version is available and/or the project requires a new version for compatibility.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once <code>xerces</code> is installed, open the <code>NairnMPM.xcodeproj</code> to compile the code. The process is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Select the target to compile - either <code>NairnMPM</code> or <code>NairnFEA</code></li>
<li>Choose build and they will compile</li>
<li>If there is a linking error, you might have conflicting architectures between the XCode settings and the <code>xerces</code> library you installed. To fix this problem edit <i>both</i> the project and target settings and under the &quot;Architectures&quot; section, set the &quot;Architectures&quot; option to match the architecture you used when installing <code>xerces</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once the code is compiled, do a <a href="../running/index.html">test run</a> to verify it worked.
</p>

<h2><a name="term"></a>MacOS X Command-Line Compilation</h2>

<p>It is also easy to compile on MacOS X using a command line approach. First install <code>xerces</code> and its header files as <a href="#xerces">explained above</a> and make sure they are in the specified default locations (if needed).</p>

<p>Once the library is ready, you compile <code>NairnMPM</code> using:</p>

<pre>
cd nairn-mpm-fea/NairnMPM/build
make SYSTEM=mac CFLAGS=&quot;-c -O3 -arch x86_64&quot; LFLAGS=&quot;-arch x86_64&quot;
</pre>

<p>and compile <code>NairnFEA</code> using:</p>

<pre>
cd nairn-mpm-fea/NairnFEA/build
make SYSTEM=mac CFLAGS=&quot;-c -O3 -arch x86_64&quot; LFLAGS=&quot;-arch x86_64&quot;
</pre>

<p>Here the <code>arch</code> setting must match the one used when you installed the <code>xerces</code> library. The <code>-c</code> option is required. The <code>-O3</code> option creates optimized code; this option can be changed or omitted.</p>

<p>All source code will be compiled and the executables will be installed in <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnMPM/input</code> or <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnFEA/input</code>, respectively. You can use an additional '<code>make install</code>' command to copy each compiled executable to your <code>~/bin</code> folder if desired.
</p>

<p>If the command-line compile does not work, the most likely explanation is a problem with the <code>xerces</code> installation. You either have to install it as specified <a href="#xerces">above</a> or edit the <code>makefile</code> to recognize your custom installation. The process is documented in the <code>makefile</code> and involves editing the <code>xercesSo</code> and <code>headersPath</code> variables for your different settings.
</p>

<p>Once the code is compiled, do a <a href="../running/index.html">test run</a> to verify it worked.
</p>

<a name="windows"></a><h1>Windows Using cygwin</h1>

<p>To compile and run in Windows, you need some kind of Linux/Unix environment. The recommended option is to use <a href="http://www.cygwin.com"><code>cygwin</code></a> and this documentation is based on its use. This process has be verified in both Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 (although you may need the latest <code>cygwin</code> 1.7 for Windows 7).
</p>

<p>First you need to set up your computer to use <a href="http://www.cygwin.com"><code>cygwin</code></a>. Since this set up was needed to check out the code, these steps assume <a href="http://www.cygwin.com"><code>cygwin</code></a> is already set up. If not refer to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nairn-mpm-fea/wiki/Windows_Setup">Windows setup wiki page</a> for details. To next compile the code in <a href="http://www.cygwin.com"><code>cygwin</code></a> requires these additional steps:</p>

<ol>

<li>First, you need to install <code>xerces</code> in your <code>cygwin</code> environment. Although <code>cygwin</code> has an option to install the <code>xerces</code> binary, it usually has an out-dated version. The preferred approach is to download the <code>xerces</code> source code for a newer version (2.7.0 or newer), build it, and install it. Since revision 274 of the <code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> project, the code requires <code>xerces 3.0</code> or newer. The procedure for <code>xerces 3.0</code> or newer is:
<ol class="alpha">
<li><a href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/download.cgi">Download the <code>xerces</code> source code</a>, which will be in a file such as <code>xerces-c-3.x.x.tar.gz</code> (with <code>x</code> being some numbers). Note that you should get the <code>.tar.gz</code> file instead of the <code>.zip</code> version because the <code>.zip</code> version has DOS files with carriage returns and line feeds (either in the source or inserted by Windows' zip methods) that may complicate compiliation. The <code>.tar.gz</code> file is also smaller.</li>

<li>Move the downloaded file to folder in the <code>cygwin</code> system such as your home directory. By default, the <code>cygwin</code> directory is installed at <code>C:\cygwin</code>. Start a <code>cygwin</code> shell and and extract the files with:
<pre>
cd (to directory with the download)
gunzip xerces-c-src_2_8_0.tar.gz
tar xvf xerces-c-src_2_8_0.tar
</pre></li>

<li>Go to the new folder and configure the code with:
<pre>
cd xerces-c-3.1.1
./configure LDFLAGS=-no-undefined
</pre>
This step will prepare the <code>xerces</code> source code for building. Note: if you get error messages saying that $'\r'$ command is not found it means your files are DOS files rather than Unix files. Consult a Unix expert on how to fix them or go back to step <code>a</code> and get the <code>.tar.gz</code> file this time.<br><br>
<a name="doover"></a><font color="red">Warning</font>: It is possible some versions of <code>cygwin</code> (<i>e.g.</i>, 1.7.1) may have a conflict with <code>xerces 3.x</code> that prevents the dynamic library version from linking at runtime. If that occurs, you will have to rebuild and reinstall the library as a static-only library by returning to this step and starting over with:
<pre>
cd xerces-c-3.1.1
make clean
./configure LDFLAGS=-no-undefined --disable-shared
</pre>
and then proceed with the following steps. This approach did solve the problem although the <code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code> executables will by statically linked and therefore much larger.
</li>

<li>When this configuring step is done, enter the commands
<pre>
cd src
make
</pre>
This step will compile <code>xerces</code> and save the librarys in the <code>xerces-c-3.1.1/.libs</code> folder.</li>

<li>Finally, enter the command &quot;<code>make install</code>&quot; (still in the same folder). This step will install the compiled <code>xerces</code> library and needed header files in the default locations of  <code>/usr/local/lib</code> and <code>/usr/local/include</code> folders, respectively.</li>

</ol>
</li>

<li>You are now ready to compile. In a cygwin shell, navigate to the checked out folder and proceed as follows. To compile <code>NairnMPM</code> use:

<pre>
cd nairn-mpm-fea/NairnMPM/build
make SYSTEM=cygwin
</pre>

<p>and to compile <code>NairnFEA</code> use:</p>

<pre>
cd nairn-mpm-fea/NairnFEA/build
make SYSTEM=cygwin
</pre>

<p>All source code will be compiled and the executables will be installed in <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnMPM/input</code> or <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnFEA/input</code>, respectively. You can use an additional '<code>make install</code>' command to copy each compiled executable to your <code>~/bin</code> folder if desired.
</p>

<p>If the command-line compile does not work, the most likely explanation is a problem with the <code>xerces</code> installation. You either have to install it as specified above or edit the <code>makefile</code> to recognize your custom installation. The process is documented in the <code>makefile</code> and involves editing the <code>xercesSo</code> and <code>headersPath</code> variables for your different settings. Another possible reason is a potential conflict with some versions of <code>cygwin</code>. If you get a linking error about <code>typeinfo</code> in <code>XMLException</code> being undefined, you will have to uninstall the library (from /usr/local/lib) and then <a href="#doover">rebuild the library</a> as a static-only library and try again.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>Once the code is compiled, do a <a href="../running/index.html">test run</a> to verify it worked.
</p>

<a name="eclipse"></a><h1>Compile using Eclipse IDE</h1>

<p>Working with source code is easier when done using an integrated development environment (IDE) rather than using basic text editing on a collection of source files. On MacOS X, you can use the XCode IDE (free with developer tools) and the <code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> project has an <a href="#xcode">XCode project ready to use</a>. An option for any other platform (and for MacOS X too) is to use the cross-platform IDE <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a>, which is an open-source and free IDE. This section explains how to compile <code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code> using <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a>. Experienced Eclipse users may have better methods, but the steps explained below should work. These steps were based on and older version of Eclipse from should work similary in the latest Galileo version of Eclipse (version 3.5 or newer).
</p>

<p>The first steps are to install and prepare Eclipse for C/C++ development as follows:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Before using <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a> on a new platform, you should compile the <code>Nairn-MPM-FEA</code> code using command line methods for your platform. This task verifies that you have the <code>xerces</code> library correctly installed, that the <code>makefile</code>s are valid for your system, and, for Windows, that <a href="#windows">cygwin is correctly installed</a>. All these items are prerequisites to successful compilation using <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a>.
</li>

<li>Download and install <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a>. As downloaded, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a> may only be set up for Java development, and not ready for C/C++ development (depending on what you download). To configure for C/C++ development, choose the menu command &quot;Help &rarr; Software Update &rarr; Find and Install...&quot; and follow the procedures to install the C/C++ Development Tools (or CDT)
</li>

<li>In Windows, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a> uses some <code>cygwin</code> tools and therefore projects need to know the path to the cygwin/bin folder. Thus, before creating any projects:
<ol class="alpha">
<li>Choose menu command to open Eclipse preferences</li>
<li>Find section for C/C++ &rarr; Make &rarr; New Make Projects</li>
<li>In the &quot;Environment&quot; section add the variable <code>PATH</code> with value <code>;C:\cygwin\bin;</code> (<i>i.e.</i>, the path to the bin direcetory of your cygwin folder). Make sure the option to append to native environment is selected.</li>
<li>Click OK</li>
</ol>
No such setting is required in MacOS X because, if developer tools are installed, it is automatically set up for compiling with Eclipse. On other plaftorms, some other setting may be needed for Eclipse to locate all the required tools.</li>
</ol>

<p>The above steps only need to be done the first time you compile <code>NairnMPM</code> and/or <code>NairnFEA</code>. Once they are done, you can proceed creating <code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code> projects as follows. These steps explain both at once. You can do both or just the one you need.
</p>

<ol>

<li>Create a new project and select a C/C++ standard make file project. Name it &quot;NairnMPM&quot; and click Finish. Repeat (if desired) to create a &quot;NairnFEA&quot; project.
</li>

<li>Select the NairnMPM project and create two new source folders - one called <code>src</code> and the other called <code>Common</code>. Repeat for NairnFEA project, but create just a <code>src</code> folder. <b>Note</b>: if you are compiling only <code>NairnFEA</code>, create a <code>Common</code> source folder in NairnFEA project too, otherwise that project will use the common files in the NairnMPM project.
</li>

<li>Right click (control click in MacOS X) on the <code>src</code> folder in the NairnMPM project and choose Import. Select General &rarr; File System and then browse for the <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnMPM/src</code> folder in your code check out. After selecting the folder, check its box in the left half of the window and click Finish. Repeat for NairnFEA project, but import the <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnFEA/src</code> folder into its <code>src</code> folder.
</li>

<li>Right click (control click in MacOS X) on the <code>Common</code> folder in the NairnMPM project and choose Import. Select General &rarr; File System and then browse for the <code>nairn-mpm-fea/Common</code> folder. After selecting the folder, check its box on the left half of the window. Next expand the folder deselect the <code>Projects</code> folder and click Finish. If you are compiling only <code>NairnFEA</code>, do the above step for a <code>Common</code> folder in that project, otherwise nothing else is needed in this step for the NairnFEA project.
</li>

<li>Select the NairnMPM project and create two new folders (not source folders) - one called <code>input</code> and the other called <code>build</code>. Repeat for NairnFEA project.
</li>

<li>Right click (control click in MacOS X) on the <code>build</code> folder in the NairnMPM project and choose Import. Select General &rarr; File System and then browse for the <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnMPM/build</code> folder. After selecting the folder, check its box on the left half of the window and then select the folder. On the right half of the window, select only the <code>makefile</code>. Click Finish. Repeat for NairnFEA project, but import the <code>makefile</code> in <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnFEA/build</code>.
</li>

<li>Right click (control click in MacOS X) on the <code>input</code> folder in the NairnMPM project and choose Import. Select General &rarr; File System and then browse for the <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnMPM/input</code> folder. After selecting the folder, check its box on the left half of the window and then select the folder. On the right half of the window, select only the <code>NairnMPM.dtd</code> file. Click Finish. Repeat for NairnFEA project, but import the <code>NairnFEA.dtd</code> file in <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnFEA/input</code>.
</li>

<li>Open the NairnMPM project properties. In the C/C++ make project settings or build settings, set the building directory to the <code>NairnMPM/build</code> folder. Repeat for NairnFEA project, setting the build folder to the <code>NairnFEA/build</code> folder. In that same window, change the <code>make</code> command from the default settings for NairnMPM to:
<ol class="alpha">
<li>For Windows/cygwin, change it to &quot;<code>make SYSTEM=cygwin CC=/bin/g++ RM=/bin/rm com=../Common</code>&quot;</li>
<li>For Mac, change it to &quot;<code>make SYSTEM=mac com=../Common</code>&quot;</li>
<li>For Linux, change it to &quot;<code>make com=../Common</code>&quot; (but this is untested).</li>
</ol>
For the NairnFEA project, change the <code>make</code> command from the default settings to:
<ol class="alpha">
<li>For Windows/cygwin, change it to &quot;<code>make SYSTEM=cygwin CC=/bin/g++ RM=/bin/rm com=../../NairnMPM/Common</code>&quot;</li>
<li>For Mac, change it to &quot;<code>make SYSTEM=mac com=../../NairnMPM/Common</code>&quot;</li>
<li>For Linux, change it to &quot;<code>make com=../../NairnMPM/Common</code>&quot; (but this is untested).</li>
</ol>
<b>Note:</b> If you only created the NairnFEA project and put the <code>Common</code> folder in that project, use <code>com=../Common</code> for each of these settings instead.
</li>

<li>If everything worked, you should be able to build the project by selecting the project and choosing &quot;Build Project&quot; menu command. If automatic building is selected, the project may have already been built. When done, it will install <code>NairnMPM</code> or <code>NairnFEA</code> executables into the input folders for those projects.
</li>

<li>If building did not work due to a command or target error, you may need to change the <code>make</code> command settings in step 8 or alternatively edit the <code>makefile</code>.
</li>

<li>If the initial projects had some dummy files (such as an initial <code>makefile</code> or source code for a trivial <code>main()</code>), you can delete those files.</li>

</ol>

<p>Once the code is compiled, do a <a href="../running/index.html">test run</a> to verify it worked.
</p>

<p>You can now edit source code as desired and rebuild the project. This project is a manual <code>makefile</code> project. If you add new source code, or change the dependencies of source code on header files, you will need to edit the <code>makefile</code> to reflect those changes.
</p>


<p>When you check out a new version <code>Nairn-FEA-MPM</code>, you do not need to start over. You can update simply by repeating steps 3, 4, 6, and 7 (<b>warning</b>: this update will erase any source code changes you made; if you want to keep them, you should create a new project instead or backup your old files first). The project should then be ready to build and run.</p>


<a name="linux"></a><h1>Specific Linux Systems</h1>

<p>The code can easily be compiled on any Linux system with a c++ compiler and with <code>xerces</code> already installed. Below are details on specific systems that are already set up for compilation and are currently in use for <code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code>. See the section on <a href="#other">other systems</a> for compilation on other Linux/Unix systems.
</p>

<p>On the following specific Linux systems, the source code is set up for easy compilation and <code>xerces</code> is already installed. All you need to do is you the proper variable argument in the <code>make</code> command. The details are:</p>

<h2><a name="cdmake"></a>Compilation on All Above Linux Systems
</h2>

<p>The commands for the above system will compile all source code and install the executables in <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnMPM/input</code> or <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnFEA/input</code>, respectively. Once the code is compiled, do a <a href="../running/index.html">test run</a> to verify it worked.
</p>

<a name="other"></a><h1>Other Systems</h1>

<p>Compiling on any Linux/Unix system should be straightforward, with the most difficult step usually being installing and linking to the <code>xerces</code> library. The key steps needed for successful compilation:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a compatible <code>C++</code> compiler. The code has been tested with at least <code>gcc 3.2</code> through <code>gcc 4.3.1</code>). It is possible other compilers will need minor changes for compilation.</li>

<li>Validation and parsing of the <code>XML</code> files are handled using free third party software from the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a> called the
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html"><code>xerces</code> validating XML parser</a>. You will need to download <code>xerces</code> and install it on your system. It is available in <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/install.html">binary installs</a> for some systems (<i>e.g.</i>, Linux and Windows). For others systems (<i>e.g.</i>, MacOS X) you need to download the source code and <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/build.html">build</a> it. Since revision 274 of the <code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> project, the codes require <code>xerces 3.0</code> or newer. Prior to this revision, the codes requied <code>xerces 2.8</code> or older. Unfortunately, the new versions of <code>xerces</code> are not compatible with the older ones.
</li>

<li>Compiling of <code>NairnMPM</code> or <code>NairnFEA</code> needs access to all the <code>xerces</code> header files. These are provided in the <code>xerces</code> source code downloads. Even iff your system has the xerces binary installed, it may not have the header files. You can get them by  <a href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-c/stable/">downloading the xerces source code</a>, even though you will not need to build it.</li>

</ol>

<p>Once a suitable compiler, the <code>xerces</code> binary, and <code>xerces</code> header files are installed, compilation may require editing the <code>makefile</code>s in the <code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> folders. Specifically, you will need to edit the <code>makefile</code>s in the <code>build</code> directories (<code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code>) and set the following variables:</p>

<ol>
<li>The variable <code>CC</code>: set it to the desired <code>C++</code> compiler.</li>
<li>The variable <code>xercesSo</code>: set it to the path name to the <code>xerces</code> library binary file.</li>
<li>The variable <code>headersPath</code>: set it to the path name to the folder containing the <code>xercesc</code> folder of header files.</li>
</ol>

<p>After setting the variables, use a standard <code>make</code> command to compile the code.
Once the code is compiled, do a <a href="../running/index.html">test run</a> to verify it worked.
If it compiles, but will not load the <code>xerces</code> library at runtime, you will have to find the system-dependent method to provide the path to the <code>xerces</code> library and make sure the system can find the <code>xerces</code> library.</p>

<p>If you successfully get the code compiled and running on a system that is not listed above, please send email to <a href="mailto:John.Nairn@oregonstate.edu">John.Nairn@oregonstate.edu</a> with the system name and step-by-step instructions for compiling and running the code.</p>
