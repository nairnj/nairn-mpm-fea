<h1>Start Up - Download and Compile NairnFEA, NairnMPM, and Visualization Tools</h1>

<p>This finite element (FEA) and material point method (MPM) software can run and visualized on multiple platforms. The way you use it depends on your platform and whether or not you want to edit the source code.
</p>

<p>If you are using a Mac (with MacOS 10.4 or newer, Tiger), you can go to the <a href="http://oregonstate.edu/~nairnj/NairnFEAMPM/index.html"><b>NairnFEAMPM</b> web site</a> and download a complete package that lets you create input files using a command language or raw <code>XML</code> commands, run calculations, and visualize the results. This package only works in MacOS X and does not include the NairnFEA or NairnMPM source code; thus it is only for using the software.
</p>

<p>If you are using another platform and/or if you want to work with, and possibly change, the source code, you will have to get the source code, compile it, run it, and visualize the results. The steps to getting started are:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="obtaining.html">Download the source code</a>: read this section for the various methods of getting a copy of the source code.
</li>

<li><a href="compiling.html">Compiling the source code</a>: read this section for instructions on compiling the source code on different platforms.
</li>

<li><a href="../running/index.html">Running the code</a>: once you have compiled the code, read this section to learn how to run it and to do a trial calculation.
</li>

<li><a href="nairnviz.html">Visualization Tools</a>: read this section to learn how to visualize results using <a href="http://oregonstate.edu/~nairnj/NairnFEAMPM/index.html"><b>NairnFEAMPM</b></a> (MacOS X only) or using a platform-independent java application visualization tool.
</li>
