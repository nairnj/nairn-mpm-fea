<h1><a name="top"></a>Compiling NairnMPM and NairnFEA Source Code</h1>

<p>After checking out the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nairn-mpm-fea/"><code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> project</a>, the next step is to compile it. All code-engine source code is standard <code>C++</code>  and it should be possible to compile on a variety of systems. This page gives details on some common systems. Users are responsible for compilation on other systems.</p>

</p>

<a name="xcode"></a><h1>MacOS X</h1>

<h2>XCode Compilation
</h2>

<p>Most development of <code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code> is done in MacOS X and thus compiling on MacOS X is easy. The preferred method is to use XCode (a <a href="#term">command-line method</a> is described below). A complete XCode project is located at</p>

<pre>
nairn-mpm-fea/Common/Projects/NairnMPM.xcodeproj
</pre>

<p>This project is called <code>NairnMPM</code>, but it includes all MPM and FEA source code in two targets named <code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code>.
</p>

<p><a name="xerces"></a>Before you can compile and run the project, however, you will need an installed version  of the <code>xerces</code> library and a copy of the <code>xerces</code> header files. The XCode project and <a href="#term">command-line method</a> below both assume they are installed in the default locations for MacOS X or at</p>

<pre>
/usr/local/lib/libxerces-c.dylib
</pre>

<p>for the library and at</p>

<pre>
/usr/local/include
</pre>

<p>for the header files. These can be changed if needed by editing the project and target settings. Since revision 274 of the <code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> project, this library must be <code>xerces 3.0</code> or newer; prior to that revision, it had be <code>xerces 2.8</code> or older. These libraries can be obtained by downloading the 
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html"><code>xerces</code> source code</a> from the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a> web site and then building and installing <code>xerces</code> with the following steps (after seeing potential <a href="#lion">startup issues on Lion or newer systems</a>):</p>

<ol>
<li>Open Terminal app and navigate to the xerces source folder expanded from the downloaded file.</li>
<li>Configure the code with the command:
<pre>
./configure CFLAGS="-arch x86_64" CXXFLAGS="-arch x86_64"</pre>
where the provided <code>arch</code> (or architecture) is the desired option for your machine. The main Mac options are <code>i386</code> for 32 bit Intel processors, <code>x86_64</code> for 64 bit Intel processors,  <code>ppc</code> for 32 bit PowerPC chips, or <code>ppc64</code> for 64 bit PowerPC64 chips. Although <code>i386</code> will work on any Intel processor, you should use <code>x86_64</code> if you have a 64 bit processor, because the code will run faster. To determine how many bits your Intel chip has, chose &quot;About This Mac&quot; from the Apple menu, click &quot;More Info...&quot; button, and look up the processor name in the hardware section. The &quot;Intel Core Solo&quot; and &quot;Intel Core Duo&quot; are 32 bit chips and most others are 64 bit chips.
</li>
<li>When the configuration is done, use the following commands:
<pre>
cd src
make
make install</pre>
These command make the library (but not the unneeded <code>xerces</code> examples). The final install command after <code>make</code> is done, installs the both the library and the header files at the default locations listed above. If the '<code>make install</code>' shows a permission error, you can solve that by using '<code>sudo make install</code>' instead and provide your administrator password.</li>
<li>When working with <code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> on a new Mac, the <code>xerces</code> installation only needs to be done once. The only reason to repeat it is when a new <code>xerces</code> version is available and/or the project requires a new version for compatibility.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once <code>xerces</code> is installed, open the <code>NairnMPM.xcodeproj</code> to compile the code. The process is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Select the target to compile - either <code>NairnMPM</code> or <code>NairnFEA</code></li>
<li>Choose build and they will compile and saves in the <code>nairn-mpm-fea/Common/Projects/build/Default</code> directory</li>
<li>If there is a linking error, you might have conflicting architectures between the XCode settings and the <code>xerces</code> library you installed. To fix this problem edit <i>both</i> the project and target settings and under the &quot;Architectures&quot; section, set the &quot;Architectures&quot; option to match the architecture you used when installing <code>xerces</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once the code is compiled, do a <a href="../running/index.html">test run</a> to verify it worked.
</p>

<h2><a name="term"></a>MacOS X Command-Line Compilation</h2>

<p>It is also easy to compile on MacOS X using a command line approach (after seeing potential <a href="#lion">startup issues on Lion or newer systems</a>). First install <code>xerces</code> and its header files as <a href="#xerces">explained above</a> and make sure they are in the specified default locations (if needed).</p>

<p>Once the library is ready, you compile <code>NairnMPM</code> using:</p>

<pre>
cd nairn-mpm-fea/NairnMPM/build
make SYSTEM=mac CFLAGS=&quot;-c -O3 -arch x86_64&quot; LFLAGS=&quot;-arch x86_64&quot;
</pre>

<p>and compile <code>NairnFEA</code> using:</p>

<pre>
cd nairn-mpm-fea/NairnFEA/build
make SYSTEM=mac CFLAGS=&quot;-c -O3 -arch x86_64&quot; LFLAGS=&quot;-arch x86_64&quot;
</pre>

<p>Here the <code>arch</code> settings must match the one used when you installed the <code>xerces</code> library. The <code>-c</code> option is required. The <code>-O3</code> option creates optimized code; this option can be changed or omitted.</p>

<p>All source code will be compiled and the executables will be installed in <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnMPM/input</code> or <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnFEA/input</code>, respectively. You can use an additional '<code>make install</code>' command to copy each compiled executable to your <code>~/bin</code> folder if desired.
</p>

<p>If the command-line compile does not work, the most likely explanation is a problem with the <code>xerces</code> installation. You either have to install it as specified <a href="#xerces">above</a> or edit the <code>makefile</code> to recognize your custom installation. The process is documented in the <code>makefile</code> and involves editing the <code>xercesSo</code> and <code>headersPath</code> variables for your different settings.
</p>

<p>Once the code is compiled, do a <a href="../running/index.html">test run</a> to verify it worked.
</p>

<h2><a name="lion"></a>MacOS X Lion or Newer Command-Line Tools</h2>

<p>For some strange reason, Apple choose not to install command line tools on Lion (or newer systems such as Mountain Lion) and makes it hard to access some very useful folders (such as your home &quot;Library&quot; folder). With these changes, you cannot compile <code>xerces</code> or <code>nairn-fea-mpm</code> before doing additional set up:</p>

<ol>
<li>Before continuing you probably have to install XCode (even if you do not plan to use it).</li>
<li>In XCode, use its preferences window to install &quot;Command Line Tools&quot;.</li>
<li>Most tools should now be available. You should be able to make and install the <code>xerces</code> project and then use the provided XCode project to build <code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>One issue in the XCode project is that it might not find your <code>xerces</code> library, even if it is in the standard location. If it is not found, the library will be in <font color="red">red</font> in the &quot;External Frameworks and Libraries&quot; folder. You have to select the library, view its properties, and then click to set the path on your computer. The problem is that you cannot navigate to the <code>/usr/local/lib</code> folder anymore (another new Apple &quot;feature&quot;). Here is a trick to get there:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the Finder, use the &quot;Go to Folder...&quot; menu command and enter &quot;<code>/usr/local</code>&quot;.</li>
<li>After it opens, choose the &quot;Add To Sidebar&quot; menu command. This folder will now appear in all file selection boxes.</li>
<li>Go back to XCode and enter box to select the path the the <code>xerces</code> library.</li>
<li>Go through your new &quot;local&quot; folder and select the <code>xerces</code> library file in <code>/usr/local/lib</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Apple is trying hard to stop you from using you computer for interesting programming. With a few tricks it is still possible to get around their road blocks. Hopefully the tricks will continue to work in the future.</p>

<a name="windows"></a><h1>Windows Using cygwin</h1>

<p>To compile and run in Windows, you need some kind of Linux/Unix environment. The recommended option is to use <a href="http://www.cygwin.com"><code>cygwin</code></a> and this documentation is based on its use. This process has be verified in both Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 (although you may need the latest <code>cygwin</code> 1.7 for Windows 7).
</p>

<p>First you need to set up your computer to use <a href="http://www.cygwin.com"><code>cygwin</code></a>. Since this set up was needed to check out the code, these steps assume <a href="http://www.cygwin.com"><code>cygwin</code></a> is already set up. If not refer to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nairn-mpm-fea/wiki/Windows_Setup">Windows setup wiki page</a> for details. The next step is to compile the code, but the first time you download the project, you will need to install <code>xerces</code> in your <a href="http://www.cygwin.com"><code>cygwin</code></a> environment (if you already have xerces installed, you can <a href="#cygcc">skip to compiling now</a>). Although <a href="http://www.cygwin.com"><code>cygwin</code></a> has an option to install the <code>xerces</code> binary, it usually has an out-dated version. You therefore will need to download the <code>xerces</code> source code, build it, and install it. Since revision 274 of the <code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> project, the code requires <code>xerces 3.0</code> or newer. The procedure for <code>xerces 3.0</code> or newer is:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/download.cgi">Download the <code>xerces</code> source code</a>, which will be in a file such as <code>xerces-c-3.x.x.tar.gz</code> (with <code>x</code> being some numbers). Note that you should get the <code>.tar.gz</code> file instead of the <code>.zip</code> version because the <code>.zip</code> version has DOS files with carriage returns and line feeds (either in the source or inserted by Windows' zip methods) that may complicate compiliation. The <code>.tar.gz</code> file is also smaller.</li>

<li>Move the downloaded file to a folder such as the root <code>cygwin</code> folder, which by default is at Windows path <code>C:\cygwin\</code> (<font color="red">warning</font>: the <code>xerces</code> install will fail if the path to the folder in <code>cygwin</code> contains any spaces; if you use the recommended root folder, the path will be &quot;<code>/</code>&quot; which has no spaces and is therefore safe).</li>
<li>Start a <code>cygwin</code> shell and and extract the files with:
<pre>
cd /
gunzip xerces-c-3.x.x.tar.gz
tar xvf xerces-c-3.x.xtar</pre>
where the <code>x</code>'s are replaced by numbers in your downloaded file.</li>

<li>Go to the new folder and configure the code with:
<pre>
cd xerces-c-3.x.x
./configure LDFLAGS=-no-undefined
</pre>
This step will prepare the <code>xerces</code> source code for building. Note: if you get error messages saying that $'\r'$ command is not found it means your files are DOS files rather than Unix files. Consult a Unix expert on how to fix them or go back to step <code>1</code> and get the <code>.tar.gz</code> file this time.
</li>

<li>When this configuring step is done, enter the commands
<pre>
cd src
make</pre>
This step will compile <code>xerces</code> and save the librarys in the <code>xerces-c-3.x.x/.libs</code> folder.</li>

<li>Finally, enter the command &quot;<code>make install</code>&quot; (still in the same folder). This step will install the compiled <code>xerces</code> libraries and needed header files in the default locations of <code>/usr/local/lib</code> and <code>/usr/local/include</code> folders, respectively.</li>

</ol>

<p><a name="cygcc"></a>You are now ready to compile the <code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> code. In a <code>cygwin</code> shell, navigate to the checked out <code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> and proceed as follows. To compile <code>NairnMPM</code> use:</p>

<pre>
cd nairn-mpm-fea/NairnMPM/build
make SYSTEM=cygwin
</pre>

<p>and to compile <code>NairnFEA</code> use:</p>

<pre>
cd nairn-mpm-fea/NairnFEA/build
make SYSTEM=cygwin
</pre>

<p>All source code will be compiled and the executables will be installed in <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnMPM/input</code> or <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnFEA/input</code>, respectively. You can use an additional '<code>make install</code>' command to copy each compiled executable to your <code>~/bin</code> folder if desired.
</p>

<p>If the command-line compile does not work, the most likely explanation is a problem with the <code>xerces</code> installation. You either have to install it as specified above or edit the <code>makefile</code> to recognize your custom installation. The process is documented in the <code>makefile</code> and involves editing the <code>xercesSo</code> and <code>headersPath</code> variables for your different settings. Another possible reason is a potential conflict with some <code>cygwin</code>/Windows combinations. If you get a linking error about undefined references to <code>typeinfo</code>, you have encountered a dynamic linking problem. It can be fixed by deleting the dynamic library at <code>/usr/local/lib/libserces-c.dll.a</code> and then use the '<code>make SYSTEM=cygwin</code>' command to link again. This change will cause the code to link statically. The resulting executables will be much larger but should work fine.
</p>

<p>Once the code is compiled, do a <a href="../running/index.html">test run</a> to verify it worked.
</p>

<a name="eclipse"></a><h1>Compile using Eclipse IDE</h1>

<p>Working with source code is easier when done using an integrated development environment (IDE) rather than using basic text editing on a collection of source files. On MacOS X, you can use the XCode IDE (free with developer tools) and the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nairn-mpm-fea/"><code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> project</a> has an <a href="#xcode">XCode project ready to use</a>. An option for any other platform (and an alternative option for MacOS X) is to use the cross-platform IDE <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a>, which is an open-source and free IDE. This section explains how to compile <code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code> using <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a>. These steps were based on the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse Indigo (version 3.7)</a>, but are likely to work in other versions as well. They work for MacOS, Windows, and Linux.
</p>

<p>Before attempting to use <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a>, it is recommended that you compile using the command-line approach for your platform (<a href="#term">Mac</a>, <a href="#windows">Windows</a>, or <a href="#linux">Linux</a>) first. This process verifies you have all tools needed by <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a> for compiling and verifies that <code>xerces</code> is correctly installed.</p>

<p><a name="geteclipse"></a>The first steps (which are only needed once) are to install and prepare <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a> for C/C++ development. You will need <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a> and will need to install tools for subversion. Subversion will be used to directly check out the code from <a href="http://code.google.com" target="new">google code</a> into an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a> project (even though you should have checked out the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nairn-mpm-fea/"><code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> project</a> to verify command-line compile, this process will checkout another copy for compiling in <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a>):
</p>

<ol>
<li>Download and install <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" target="new">Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers</a>. These steps were based on use of <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse Indigo (version 3.7)</a>, but other versions should work by similar steps. Most system have 32 bit or 64 bit options. Choose the one best for your system. Note that <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a> is a Java application and thus if you choose a 64 bit option, you will need to have 64 bit Java as well.
</li>

<li>Start <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a> and create or select your workspace.</li>

<li>Install tools for subversion (this step and the next). Choose &quot;Install New Software...&quot; menu command, choose download site to &quot;work with.&quot; Once loaded, choose &quot;Subversive SVN Team Provider&quot; in the &quot;Collaboration&quot; section and proceed to installation. After installation, restart <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a>.
</li>

<li>Use of subversion also needs a &quot;connector.&quot; In theory, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a> will ask you to install a connector the first time you need it. You can force it to need it by opening <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a> preferences and choosing &quot;Team &rarr; SVN&quot; or by trying to create a new project using &quot;SVN &rarr; Project from SVN.&quot; When asked, select a connector that is compatible with your version of subversion (to check your version, use &quot;<code>svn --version</code>&quot; in your command-line tool). You can select more than one if you want and choose the one to use in the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a> preferences (under &quot;Team &rarr; SVN&quot;). After installation, restart <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a>. (Hint: if no connector is installed and you are not asked to install one when needed, try restarting <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a>).
</li>

<li>(Optional) If you intend to do Java development (such as <a href="nairnviz.html#eclipses">compiling the <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b> Java application</a>), you should also install Java development tools. Choose &quot;New Software...&quot;, select site, and then select &quot;Eclipse Java Development&quot; from the section on &quot;Programming Languages&quot;. After installation, restart <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>You are now ready to create a project for compiling the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nairn-mpm-fea/"><code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> project</a>.</p>

<ol>

<li>Start <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a>, choose &quot;New &rarr; Project...&quot; and then select &quot;SVN &rarr; Project from SVN.&quot;</li>

<li>You will be asked to select an SVN repository. Enter the following settings followed by clicking &quot;Next&quot;:
<ul>
<li>URL: <code>https://nairn-mpm-fea.googlecode.com/svn/trunk</code></li>
<li>User: enter your gmail name for access to <a href="http://code.google.com" target="new">google code</a> (this process is assuming you have been added as a &quot;contributor&quot; to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nairn-mpm-fea/"><code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> project</a>. You can request to be added by <a href="mailto:John.Nairn@oregonstate.edu">sending email to project owner</a>.</li>
<li>Password: Enter the password generated for you in the &quot;Profile &rarr; Settings&quot; section when logged onto <a href="http://code.google.com" target="new">google code</a>.</li>
<li>For anonymous checkout you might be able to omit username and password, but change the URL to begin in <code>http://</code> instead of <code>https://</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Choose &quot;Head Revision&quot; for latest version or use date or revision options for older versions and then click &quot;Next.&quot;</li>

<li>In final project dialog, select project with a custom name and enter &quot;nairn-mpm-fea&quot; or any other name you prefer. This name will be used in your <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a> workspace folders. When you click to &quot;Finish,&quot; the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nairn-mpm-fea/"><code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> project</a> will be checked out into your <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a> workspace.</li>

<li>The checkout has all files, but it not an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a> project. The next step is to select the project in the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a> navigator and choose &quot;New &rarr; Convert to a C/C++ Project. When asked, choose the project to be an &quot;Executable&quot; and choose appropriate tool chain (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a> compiles using outside tools). For Mac choose &quot;MacOS GCC.&quot; For Windows choose &quot;cygwin GCC.&quot; For Linux choose &quot;Linux GCC.&quot;</li>

<li>Reconfigure the project from its default build settings to use the <code>make</code> files provided in the source code:
<ul>
<li>Choose the project properties and select &quot;C/C++ Build.&quot;</li>
<li>Click &quot;Manage Configurations...&quot; and edit until there are two configurations - one named <code>NairnMPM</code> and one named <code>NairnFEA</code>.</li>
<li>Back in the &quot;C/C++&quot; window, select the <code>NairnMPM</code> configuration and then:
<ul>
<li>Uncheck &quot;Use default build command&quot; and change it to be &quot;<code>make SYSTEM=mac</code>&quot; (for MacOS) or &quot;<code>make SYSTEM=cygwin</code>&quot; (for Windows). The default setting can be left in place for Linux.</li>
<li>Uncheck the &quot;Generate Makefiles automatically&quot;, click &quot;Workspace...&quot; and select <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnMPM/build</code> as the build directory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select the <code>NairnFEA</code> configuration and repeat the previous step (except choose the <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnFEA/build</code> directory instead.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ol>

<p>The project should now be ready to compile. To verify, set the active configuration (<code>NairnMPM</code> or <code>NairnFEA</code>) and then choose build. The progress should appear in the console. When done the executable will be installed in <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnMPM/input</code> or in <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnFEA/input</code>. Once the code is compiled, do a <a href="../running/index.html">test run</a> to verify it worked.</p>

<p>You might be able to run from Eclipse, but a better approach is probably to run the compiled code by <a name="nairnviz.html#nairnfeampm">using <b>NairnFEAMPM</b></a> (on MacOS X computers) or by <a href="nairnviz.html#nairnviz">using the <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b> Java application</a> (all other platforms). By this approach, the development process would be:</p>

<ol>

<li>Make changes to the code and then build the executables.</li>

<li>Start <a href="nairnviz.html#nairnfeampm"><b>NairnFEAMPM</b></a> or the <a href="nairnviz.html#nairnviz"><b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b> Java application</a> and run calculations using the new compiled executables. For this process to use the new executables, you should set the application preferences to point to the executables and <code>DTD</code> files in your  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="new">Eclipse</a> workspace.</li>

<li>When a new version of the code is available, right click (control click on Mac) on the project and choose &quot;Team &rarr; Update.&quot; You are ready to re-build and run.</li>

<li>If you are certified as a project committer, save your changes by right clicking (or control clicking on Mac) on the project name and choosing &quot;Team &rarr; Commit...&quot;</li>
</ol>

<a name="linux"></a><h1>Specific Linux Systems</h1>

<p>The code can easily be compiled on any Linux system with a c++ compiler and with <code>xerces</code> already installed. Below are details on specific systems that are already set up for compilation and are currently in use for <code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code>. See the section on <a href="#other">other systems</a> for compilation on other Linux/Unix systems.
</p>

<p>On the following specific Linux systems, the source code is set up for easy compilation and <code>xerces</code> is already installed. All you need to do is you the proper variable argument in the <code>make</code> command. The details are:</p>

<p>If you are using Inferno in the <a href="http://www.utah.edu/">University or Utah</a>, <a href="http://www.csafe.utah.edu/">CSAFE Group</a>, the commands are:
</p>
<pre>
cd nairn-mpm-fea/NairnMPM/build
make SYSTEM=inferno
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>
cd nairn-mpm-fea/NairnFEA/build
make SYSTEM=inferno

<h2><a name="cdmake"></a>Compilation on All Above Linux Systems
</h2>

<p>The commands for the above system will compile all source code and install the executables in <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnMPM/input</code> or <code>nairn-mpm-fea/NairnFEA/input</code>, respectively. Once the code is compiled, do a <a href="../running/index.html">test run</a> to verify it worked.

<a name="other"></a><h1>Other Systems</h1>

<p>Compiling on any Linux/Unix system should be straightforward, with the most difficult step usually being installing and linking to the <code>xerces</code> library. The key steps needed for successful compilation:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a compatible <code>C++</code> compiler. The code has been tested with at least <code>gcc 3.2</code> through <code>gcc 4.3.1</code>). It is possible other compilers will need minor changes for compilation.</li>

<li>Validation and parsing of the <code>XML</code> files are handled using free third party software from the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a> called the
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html"><code>xerces</code> validating XML parser</a>. You will need to download <code>xerces</code> and install it on your system. It is available in <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/install.html">binary installs</a> for some systems (<i>e.g.</i>, Linux and Windows). For others systems (<i>e.g.</i>, MacOS X) you need to download the source code and <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/build.html">build</a> it. Since revision 274 of the <code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> project, the codes require <code>xerces 3.0</code> or newer. Prior to this revision, the codes requied <code>xerces 2.8</code> or older. Unfortunately, the new versions of <code>xerces</code> are not compatible with the older ones.
</li>

<li>Compiling of <code>NairnMPM</code> or <code>NairnFEA</code> needs access to all the <code>xerces</code> header files. These are provided in the <code>xerces</code> source code downloads. Even iff your system has the xerces binary installed, it may not have the header files. You can get them by  <a href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-c/stable/">downloading the xerces source code</a>, even though you will not need to build it.</li>

</ol>

<p>Once a suitable compiler, the <code>xerces</code> binary, and <code>xerces</code> header files are installed, compilation may require editing the <code>makefile</code>s in the <code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> folders. Specifically, you will need to edit the <code>makefile</code>s in the <code>build</code> directories (<code>NairnMPM</code> and <code>NairnFEA</code>) and set the following variables:</p>

<ol>
<li>The variable <code>CC</code>: set it to the desired <code>C++</code> compiler.</li>
<li>The variable <code>xercesSo</code>: set it to the path name to the <code>xerces</code> library binary file.</li>
<li>The variable <code>headersPath</code>: set it to the path name to the folder containing the <code>xercesc</code> folder of header files.</li>
</ol>

<p>After setting the variables, use a standard <code>make</code> command to compile the code.
Once the code is compiled, do a <a href="../running/index.html">test run</a> to verify it worked.
If it compiles, but will not load the <code>xerces</code> library at runtime, you will have to find the system-dependent method to provide the path to the <code>xerces</code> library and make sure the system can find the <code>xerces</code> library.</p>

<p>If you successfully get the code compiled and running on a system that is not listed above, please send email to <a href="mailto:John.Nairn@oregonstate.edu">John.Nairn@oregonstate.edu</a> with the system name and step-by-step instructions for compiling and running the code.</p>
