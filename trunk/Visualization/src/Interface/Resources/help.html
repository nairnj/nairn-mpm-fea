<h1><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h1>

<p><b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b> is a graphical interface and front end to running and
visualizing finite element calculations (FEA) and material point method calculations
(MPM) in the <code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> computational mechanics package. The calculations are done that package's code engines called <code>NairnFEA</code> (for FEA) and <code>NairnMPM</code> (for MPM). This Java application, launches tasks using these code engines to <a href="#running">run calculations</a> and opens the
results files to <a href="#viz">visualize</a> the results.
</p>

<p>This documentation is very brief. More complete documentation of the <code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> package is given on the <a href="http://osupdocs.forestry.oregonstate.edu/index.php/Main_Page">OSUPDocs wiki</a> (which can also be accessed using the "internet" icon in this help window's tool bar.</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h1><a name="running"></a>Running Calculations</h1>

<p>The section explains how to launch calculations. Once the calculations are done,
the results will automatically open for visualization.
</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="setup"></a>Setting up the System<hr></h2>

<p>Before you can run any calculations in <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b>, you have to download
and compile the <code>NairnFEA</code> and <code>NairnMPM</code> code engines.
These code engines can be installed on any platform. The details are not given is this
help. Instead refer to the <code>nairn-mpm-fea</code> wiki page (see <a href="http://osupdocs.forestry.oregonstate.edu/index.php/Main_Page">OSUPDocs wiki</a> or using "internet" icon in tool bar). The wiki has complete instructions for getting the package and compiling the code engines.
</p>

<p>Once the code engines are compiled, you have to configure <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b> to
know the location of the compiled binaries and (optionally) their <code>DTD</code> files.
The process is:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose the &quot;Preferences...&quot; menu command (or click the
&quot;Prefs&quot; icon).</li>

<li>Select the &quot;Code&quot; tab</li>

<li>Click the &quot;Change...&quot; button for the  &quot;MPM Code Path&quot; and select
the <code>NairnMPM</code> (or <code>NairnMPM.exe</code> in Windows) compiled object.</li>

<li>If you want to validate <code>NairnMPM</code> input files using the <code>DTD</code>
file provided with the code engine source code, repeat for &quot;MPM DTD File Path&quot;
and select the <code>NairnMPM.dtd</code> file. To validate MPM calculations
check the &quot;Validate&quot; option (recommended); uncheck it to skip validation.</li>

<li>Repeat for the &quot;FEA Code Path&quot; and select the <code>NairnFEA</code>
(or <code>NairnFEA.exe</code> in Windows) compiled object.</li>

<li>If you want to validate <code>NairnFEA</code> input files using the <code>DTD</code>
file provided with the code engine source code, repeat for &quot;FEA DTD File Path&quot;
and select the <code>NairnFEA.dtd</code> file. To validate FEA calculations
check the &quot;Validate&quot; option (recommended); uncheck it to skip validation.</li>

<li>Click the &quot;Change...&quot; button for the &quot;Shell Command&quot;
and select the or <code>bash</code> command (or <code>bash.exe</code> in Windows)
in your system. It is normally in the <code>/bin</code> folder. In Windows,
it will be located in the <code>/bin</code> folder within
the <code>cygwin</code> folder.</li>

<li>You can optionally define a work space folder using &quot;Change...&quot; button
in the &quot;Work Space Directory&quot; section. Select any folder and that folder
will be the default folder when opening and saving files. Any change made to the
work space will only affect new windows.
</li>

</ol>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="opencmds"></a>Opening or Creating a Commands File<hr></h2>

<p>To open an existing commands file, choose the &quot;Open...&quot; menu command
(or click the&quot; Open...&quot; icon) and select the file from the file choosing dialog box or choose
file from the &quot;Open Recent&quot; submenu.
Command files usually have extension <code>fmcmd</code> but can also have <code>fcmd</code>,
<code>mcmd</code>, or just <code>cmd</code>. To restrict the files you can open to just
command files, choose &quot;MPM and FEA Command Files&quot; from the file format menu.
If the file you want to open does not show up, you can try selecting &quot;All Files&quot;
from the menu instead.
</p>

<p>To create a new commands file, select &quot;New FEA Commands&quot; or &quot;New MPM Commands&quot;
menu command (or click the &quot;F&quot; or &quot;M&quot; icon, respectively. These options
will open a new file with a template of commands for that type of calculation.
Before you run calculations using new commands, they must be saved to disk. Use the &quot;Save&quot;
or &quot;Save As...&quot; menu commands (or the &quot;Save&quot; icon) to save to any location.
The commands loaded also provide an example FEA calculation (for bending of a cantilever beam) or
MPM calculation (for simple tensile test). You can <a href="#start">run</a> them to see example calculation results.
</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="entercmds"></a>Entering Commands<hr></h2>

<p>Once commands are open, you can edit the commands using basic text editing methods.</p>

<p>There are two types of command files. The recommended approach is to use the built-in scripting language. Using scripts provides maximum flexibility in setting up calculations because they can contain things like variables, conditionals, repeat loop, <i>etc</i>. When you interpret a script, the commands create XML commands that are sent to the code engines. See the help topic on <a href="commands.html">scripting commands</a> for more details (or click the "note pad" icon in this window's tool bar to access that help).</p>

<p>An alternate approach is to directly enter the XML commands supported by the <code>NairnFEA</code> and <code>NairnMPM</code> code engines This approach is much less flexible than scripted commands and this help has no information of the format for XML commands. If you need to know about XML commands, you can refer to the <a href="http://osupdocs.forestry.oregonstate.edu/index.php/Main_Page">OSUPDocs wiki</a> (the wiki's XML information is sometimes useful when debugged scripted files too).</p>

<p>You can save the commands at any time using the &quot;Save&quot; or &quot;Save As...&quot; menu 
commands (or the &quot;Save&quot; icon).
</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="start"></a>Starting FEA or MPM Analysis<hr></h2>

<p>To run an FEA or MPM analysis using the commands in the front window:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose &quot;Run FEA/MPM Analysis&quot; from the Analyze menu (or click the &quot;Run&quot;
arrow icon). If the commands have not yet
been saved to a file, you will have to save them first.
</li>

<li>Next, a file-choosing dialog will open for you enter where to save the output results.
Choose a file with extension <code>fea</code> for FEA calculations or with extension
<code>mpm</code> for MPM calculations. Some important points are:

<ul>
<li>If you select an existing output file, the new results will overwrite that
file without asking.</li>

<li>If you do not use the proper extension, it will be added to the file for you.</li>

<li>As a convenience, when you re-run a calculation, the dialog to select the output
file will initially select the previous output file and you can click OK to select
and overwrite it.</li>

<li>If you select a different folder than the one with the input commands file,
a copy of the commands file will be written to that folder too. If a commands file of
the selected name is already in that folder, the copy will overwrite that file without asking.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>The calculation will run and the output will stream to the bottom of the commands window.
When the calculation is done, the output results will automatically
open for <a href="#viz">visualization</a>.
You can stop a calculation in progress with the &quot;Stop&quot; menu command.
If any results were finished, you can click the &quot;Image&quot; icon
to open the partial results for <a href="#viz">visualization</a>
(note: there may be a slight delay after selecting &quot;Stop&quot; before the task terminates
and the file is saved and ready for visualization).
</ol>

<h3>Background Jobs</h3>

<p>For long calculations, it is convenient to submit them as background jobs.
To submit a background job, choose the &quot;Background FEA/MPM Analysis&quot; menu command.
The subsequent steps are identical to running a calculation except that once submitted, nothing streams to the commands window. You can then proceed with other calculations or even quit <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b>. The background job will run until it is complete. Once it is complete, you can <a href="#opening">open the results file for visualization</a>.
</p>

<h3>Checking the Mesh</h3>

<p>Sometimes it is convenient to start a calculation, set up the mesh, but
then abort before continuing. This option is useful for checking
the setup of the problem to verify the mesh, particles,
and/or boundary conditions are correct. You can <a href="#opening">open the problem setup for
visualization</a> and plot the initial mesh. To use this option, select
the &quot;Test FEA/MPM Mesh...&quot; command (or click the &quot;Check&quot; arrow icon).
The subsequent steps are identical to
running a calculation except that once the problem is setup, the calculation will abort,
the ouput file will be opened for visualization, and the initial mesh will
appear in a plot window.</p>

<h3>Interpreting Commands</h3>

<p>Choosing the &quot;Interpret Commands...&quot; menu command will display the XML input file in the bottom half of the commands window, but will not launch the code engines. This command is most useful when using scripting commands and you want to verify they are creating the expected XML input file. You can refer to the <a href="http://osupdocs.forestry.oregonstate.edu/index.php/Main_Page">OSUPDocs wiki</a> for information on the XML command formats.</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h1><a name="viz"></a>Visualizing Results</h1>

<p>This section explains how to visualization FEA or MPM results. The results can be from
calculations you just ran in <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b> or from prior results run another day
or even on another computer using different software.</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="newcalcs"></a>Visualization Completed Calculations<hr></h2>

<p>If you <a href="#start">run calculations</a> within <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b>, the results
will automatically open ready for visualization. While viewing the results, you can click
the &quot;Editer&quot; icon to switch back to the commands window. From the commands window,
you can switch back to the result window by clicking the &quot;Image&quot; icon. Even if
the result window has been closed, the &quot;Image&quot; icon will reopen the
most-recently completed calculations for those commands during the current
use of <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b>.
</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="opening"></a>Opening a File<hr></h2>

<p>To open an output results file from previous calculations, choose
the &quot;Open...&quot; menu command
(or click the&quot; Open...&quot; icon) and select the file from the file choosing
dialog box or choose a file from the &quot;Open Recent&quot; submenu.
Output results files usually have extension <code>fea</code> or <code>mpm</code>.
To restrict the files you can open to just output files, choose &quot;MPM and FEA Output Files&quot;
from the file format menu. If the file you want to open does not show up,
you can try selecting &quot;All Files&quot; from the menu instead.
You should select only the main text output files from <code>NairnFEA</code> or
<code>NairnMPM</code> and not any associated text or binary file.</p>

<p>Once a file is selected, it will open and the results will be loaded into a window:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Each section of results will be listed on the top-left. Click on any section to see it.</li>

<li>The text from the selected section will appear on the top-right.</li>

<li>The bottom of the window will be a control panel for selecting all plotting options.</li>

</ul>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="plotting"></a>Plotting Results<hr></h2>

<p>To visualize results:</p>

<a href="#movies">Movie plots of MPM results</a> based on particle results.
<br><img src="TimePlots.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="#timeplot">Plots <i>vs.</i> time</a> for MPM results
<br><img src="MeshPlots.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="#meshplots">Mesh plots of MPM or FEA results</a>. MPM results are particle results
extrapolated to the mesh and plotted as movies <i>vs.</i> time. FEA plots are full mesh plots.
<br><img src="Mesh2DPlots.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="#mesh2Dplots">Plots along mesh contours</a> of MPM or FEA results.
</li>

<li>Once the plot type is selected, follow the blue line to select all plotting options for
that type of plot. See information on that plot type for details.
</li>

<li>When all options are selected, click the &quot;Plot&quot; button
(or use the "Plot Results" menu command or click the &quot;Image&quot;icon)
to plot the results. The plot will appear in a new window.
</li>

<li>To get a new plot, select new options and click the &quot;Plot&quot; button again
(which may have changed to &quot;Replot&quot; or &quot;Add Plot&quot;, depending on plot type
and if the previous plot window is still open) or use the plotting menu command or icon.
</li>

<li>You can use the Preferences window to change colors used in the plots.</li>

<li>The &quot;Scale Results...&quot; menu command can scale length and time units. It only
affect the mesh, particle locations, velocities, and concentration gradients. Stress remain in
MPa, strains in %, and energies in J. When you select new units, all current plot window
will close and have to be reopened to see the new units.</li>

</ol>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="movies"></a>Particle Plot Movies<hr></h2>

<p>First select the plotting options</p>

<ul>
<li>The first pop-up menu selects the calculation result to plot.

(<i>e.g.</i> the <i>xx</i> component of the stress tensor).</li>

<li>The slider selects the initial time to plot for MPM results.
</li>

<li>The check boxes select various options for the plot; check the desired options.
The slider along with the check boxes sets the size of the particles in the plot relative
to the cell size in the background mesh. The default is 50%. A larger size can fill space better,
especially when clipping mesh plots to the particles.</li>

<li><a name="limits"></a>The limits box has three options.
<ul>
<li>Dynamic Limits: adjust limits of each frame to maximum and minimum of the frame data.</li>

<li>Global Dynamic Limits: adjust limits to global minimum and maximum of all previously
plotted data in that window. After going through all frames once, the minimum and maximum will
be the limits of all data sets.</li>

<li>Fixed Limits: Enter desired minimum and maximum in the provided fields.</li>

<li> Note: you can change limits options for the current plot. The new limits will take effect when you plot a new frame or if you click the &quot;Replot&quot; button.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Once all options are selected, click the &quot;Plot&quot; button
(or use the "Plot Results" menu command or click the &quot;Image&quot; icon)
and the plot will appear in a new window. A key to the plot colors will appear
at the bottom of the plot area.
You can resize the window to scale the plot size to the new window size.
</p>

<p>You can use slider at the bottom of the window to plot results at
different times or use the &quot;Play,&quot;
&quot;Rewind,&quot; and &quot;Pause&quot; buttons to run a movie of MPM results.</p>

<p>You can use the quantity and component menus to plot a new
simulation result or new component of the current simulation result. To change other plot features, go back
to the &quot;Analysis Results&quot; window, select new options, and plot again.</p>

<p>You can use the &quot;Zoom&quot; menu to zoom in on the plot. The zoom level is relative to the
current window size and will remain so as the window is resized.
Choose &quot;100%&quot; to see the entire plot.
</p>

<p>You can move the mouse over the plot area. As it moves, the control bar will
display the coordinates of the mouse location (x and y),
the nearest element (el), the nearest node (nd), the nearest material point (mp), and
the plotting value of the nearest material point (z)
</p>

<p><a name="exportpng"></a>The &quot;Export Graphics...&quot; command in the &quot;File&quot; menu
will export the current frame to a <code>png</code> file using a name you provide.
The &quot;Export Movie Frames...&quot; command will export a series of
frames (starting from current) to the end of the frames (or until the pause control is clicked).
The names of the exported frames will use the base name you enter and append a number
(<i>e.g.</i>, 0022) for the frame index number just prior to the <code>.png</code>
extension. These saved files will overwrite any files in the target folder with the same name.
This naming can be read by other software (such as reading an &quot;Image Sequence&quot; into ImageJ)
that can convert the frames to a movie.</p>

the pop-up menu and select &quot;<code>x=</code>&quot; to give <code>x</code> as a
function of <code>y</code>, &quot;<code>y=</code>&quot; to give <code>y</code> as
a function of <code>x</code>, &quot;<code>D=</code>&quot; to give distance from
the origin <code>D</code> as a function of polar angle <code>T</code>, or
&quot;<code>T=</code>&quot; to give polar angle <code>T</code> as a function of distance
from the origin <code>D</code>. Select the contour option from the menu and then enter
an expression of the complementary variable in the text field. The
polar angle <code>T</code> is counter-clockwise angle from the positive <code>x</code> axis.
The resulting plot will be the selected plot quantity as a function of distance along the path.
The expression can be a constant value. A constant for an <code>x</code> contour will
be a vertical line. A constant or a <code>y</code> contour will be a horizontal line.
A constant for a <code>D</code> contour will be a circle with the entered radius.
A constant for a <code>T</code> contour will be a line from the origin at that polar angle T.
</li>

<li>The &quot;+/-&quot; field can enter a range for calculating an average plot quantity.
If it is not zero, the selected quantity will be averaged over that distance on
both sides of the path and normal to the path.</li>

<li>For crack results (<i>e.g.</i>, &quot;Crack Profile&quot;) select the crack number.
Cracks are numbered starting from 1. For crack plots, the plot will be along the crack
path and thus there is no need to select a contour (see previous step) and no need to
select a crack tip (as needed for crack tip parameters in <a href="#timeplot">time plots</a>)
</li>
</ul>

<p>Once all options are selected, click the &quot;Plot&quot; button
(or use the "Plot Results" menu command or click the &quot;Image&quot;icon)
and the plot will
appear in a new window. You can plot additional quantities on the same plot by selecting
new options (while the previous plot window is still open) and then clicking the
&quot;Add Plot&quot; button (or using the menu command or icon).
</p>

<p>Once a mesh contour plot is open, there are numerous options
(see <a href="#2Doptions">above</a> for details).

<h2><a name="viz3D"></a>Visualizing 3D MPM Results<hr></h2>

<p>You can <a href="#start">run 3D calculations</a> using this tool or run 3D calculations on
a standard command line and even open the results in this Java application, but the visualization options
are very limited. You can only look at text output
and plot reults <i>vs.</i> time. Furthermore, with the exception of plotting global results, the time plots
will be very slow for large calculations.</p>

<p>For other options on visualizing 3D results, you can consult the <a href="http://osupdocs.forestry.oregonstate.edu/index.php/Main_Page#Visualization">OSUPDOcs wiki</a>. The other options use a Mac or use other software (such as MatLab and ParaView) along with VTK legacy file output.</p>
