<h1><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h1>

<p><b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b> is a graphical interface and front end to running and
visualizing finite element calculations (FEA) and material point method calculations
(MPM). The calculations are done by separate code engines called <code>NairnFEA</code>
(for FEA) and <code>NairnMPM</code> (for MPM). This Java application, launches tasks
using these code engines to <a href="#running">run calculations</a> and opens the
results files to <a href="#viz">visualize</a> the results.
</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h1><a name="running"></a>Running Calculations</h1>

<p>The section explains how to launch calculations. Once the calculations are done,
the results will automatically open for visualization.
</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="setup"></a>Setting up the System<hr></h2>

<p>Before you can run any calculations in <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b>, you have to download
and compile the <code>NairnFEA</code> and <code>NairnMPM</code> code engines.
These code engines can be installed on any platform. The details are not given is this
help. Instead refer to the code engine web site
(<code>http://oregonstate.edu/~nairnj/FEAMPM</code>) and to the documentation in the
code engine source code package.
</p>

<p>Once the code engines are compiled, you have to configure <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b> to
know the location of the compiled binaries and (optionally) their <code>DTD</code> files.
The process is:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose the &quot;Preferences...&quot; menu command (or click the
&quot;Prefs&quot; icon).</li>

<li>Select the &quot;Code&quot; tab</li>

<li>Click the &quot;Change...&quot; button for the  &quot;MPM Code Path&quot; and select
the <code>NairnMPM</code> (or <code>NairnMPM.exe</code> in Windows) compiled object.</li>

<li>If you want to validate <code>NairnMPM</code> input files using the <code>DTD</code>
file provided with the code engine source code, repeat for &quot;MPM DTD File Path&quot;
and select the <code>NairnMPM.dtd</code> file. To validate MPM calculations
check the &quot;Validate&quot; option; uncheck it to skip validation (not recommended).</li>

<li>Repeat for the &quot;FEA Code Path&quot; and select the <code>NairnFEA</code>
(or <code>NairnFEA.exe</code> in Windows) compiled object.</li>

<li>If you want to validate <code>NairnFEA</code> input files using the <code>DTD</code>
file provided with the code engine source code, repeat for &quot;FEA DTD File Path&quot;
and select the <code>NairnFEA.dtd</code> file. To validate FEA calculations
check the &quot;Validate&quot; option; uncheck it to skip validation (not recommended).</li>

<li>Click the &quot;Change...&quot; button for the &quot;Shell Command&quot;
and select the or <code>bash</code> command (or <code>bash.exe</code> in Windows)
in your system. It is normally in the <code>/bin</code> folder. In Windows,
it will be located in the <code>/bin</code> folder within
the <code>cygwin</code> folder.</li>

<li>You can optionally define a work space folder using &quot;Change...&quot; button
in the &quot;Work Space Directory&quot; section. Select any folder and that folder
will be the default folder when opening and saving files. Any change made to the
work space will only affect new windows.
</li>

</ol>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="opencmds"></a>Opening or Creating a Commands File<hr></h2>

<p>To open an existing commands file, choose the &quot;Open...&quot; menu command
(or click the&quot; Open...&quot; icon) and select the file from the file choosing dialog box.
Command files usually have extension <code>fmcmd</code> but can also have <code>fcmd</code>,
<code>mcmd</code>, or just <code>cmd</code>. To restrict the files you can open to just
command files, choose &quot;MPM and FEA Command Files&quot; from the file format menu.
If the file you want to open does not show up, you can try selecting &quot;All Files&quot;
from the menu instead.
</p>

<p>To create a new commands file, select &quot;New FEA Commands&quot; or &quot;New MPM Commands&quot;
menu command (or click the &quot;F&quot; or &quot;M&quot; icon, respectively. These options
will open a new file with a template of commands for that type of calculation.
Before you run calculations using new commands, they must be saved to disk. Use the &quot;Save&quot;
or &quot;Save As...&quot; menu commands (or the &quot;Save&quot; icon) to save to any location.
The commands loaded also provide an example FEA calculation (for bending of a cantilever beam) or
MPM calculation (for simple tensile test). You can <a href="#start">run</a> them to see example calculation results.
</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="entercmds"></a>Entering Commands<hr></h2>

<p>Once commands are open, you can edit the commands using basic text editing methods.
Command files are XML files. This help does not document all the command options.
For those details, refer to the documentation in the code engine source code package.
You can save the commands at any time using the &quot;Save&quot; or &quot;Save As...&quot; menu 
commands (or the &quot;Save&quot; icon). Additional, command files are automatically
saved whenever you <a href="#start">run a calculation</a>.
</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="start"></a>Starting FEA or MPM Analysis<hr></h2>

<p>To run an FEA or MPM analysis using the commands in the front window:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose &quot;Run FEA/MPM Analysis&quot; from the Analyze menu (or click the &quot;Run&quot;
arrow icon). If the commands have not yet
been saved to a file, you will have to save them first. If the commands have been changed,
they will automatically be saved to the current file.
</li>

<li>Next, a file choosing dialog will open for you enter where to save the output results.
Choose a file with extension <code>fea</code> for FEA calculations or with extension
<code>mpm</code> for MPM calculations. Some important points are:

<ul>
<li>If you select an existing output file, the new results will overwrite that
file without asking.</li>

<li>If you do not use the proper extension, it will be added to the file for you.</li>

<li>As a convenience, when you re-run a calculation, the dialog to select the output
file will initially select the previous output file and you can click OK to select
and overwrite it.</li>

<li>If you select a different folder than the one with the input commands file,
a copy of the commands file will be written to that folder too. If a commands file of
the selected name is already in that folder, the copy will overwrite that file without asking.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>The calculation will run and the output will stream to the bottom of the commands window.
When the calculation is done, the output results will automatically
open for <a href="#viz">visualization</a>.
You can stop a calculation in progress with the &quot;Stop&quot; menu command.
If any results were finished, you can click the &quot;Image&quot; icon
to open the partial results for <a href="#viz">visualization</a>
(note: there may be a slight delay after selecting &quot;Stop&quot; before the task terminates
and the file is saved and ready for visualization).
</ol>

<h3>Background Jobs</h3>

<p>For long calculations, it is convenient to submit them as background jobs.
To submit a background job, choose the &quot;Background FEA/MPM Analysis&quot; menu command.
The subsequent steps are identical to running a calculation except that once submitted, nothing streams to the commands window. You can then proceed with other calculations or even quit <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b>. The background job will run until it is complete. Once it is complete, you can <a href="#opening">open the results file for visualization</a>.
</p>

<h3>Checking the Mesh</h3>

<p>Sometimes it is convenient to start a calculation, set up the mesh, but
then abort before continuing. This option is useful for checking
the setup of the problem to verify the mesh, particles,
and/or boundary conditions are correct. You can <a href="#opening">open the problem setup for
visualization</a> and plot the initial mesh. To use this option, select
the &quot;Test FEA/MPM Mesh...&quot; command (or click the &quot;Check&quot; arrow icon).
The subsequent steps are identical to
running a calculation except that once the problem is setup, the calculation will abort,
the ouput file will be opened for visualization, and the initial mesh will
appear in a plot window.</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h1><a name="viz"></a>Visualizing Results</h1>

<p>This section explains how to visualization FEA or MPM results. The results can be from
calculations you just ran in <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b> or from prior results run another day
or even on another computer using different software.</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="newcalcs"></a>Visualization Completed Calculations<hr></h2>

<p>If you <a href="#start">run calculations</a> within <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b>, the results
will automatically open ready for visualization. While viewing the results, you can click
the &quot;Editer&quot; icon to switch back to the commands window. From the commands window,
you can switch back to the result window by clicking the &quot;Image&quot; icon. Even if
the result window has been closed, the &quot;Image&quot; icon will reopen the
most-recently completed calculations for those commands during the current
use of <b>NairnFEAMPMViz</b>.
</p>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="opening"></a>Opening a File<hr></h2>

<p>To open an output results file from previous calculations, choose
the &quot;Open...&quot; menu command
(or click the&quot; Open...&quot; icon) and select the file from the file choosing
dialog box. Output results files usually have extension <code>fea</code> or <code>mpm</code>.
To restrict the files you can open to just output files, choose &quot;MPM and FEA Output Files&quot;
from the file format menu. If the file you want to open does not show up,
you can try selecting &quot;All Files&quot; from the menu instead.
You should select only the main text output files from <code>NairnFEA</code> or
<code>NairnMPM</code> and not any associated text or binary file.</p>

<p>Once a file is selected, it will open and the results will be loaded into a window:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Each section of results will be listed on the top-left. Click on any section to see it.</li>

<li>The text from the selected section will appear on the top-right.</li>

<li>The bottom of the window will be a control panel for selecting all plotting options.</li>

</ul>

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="plotting"></a>Plotting Results<hr></h2>

<p>To visualize results:</p>

<li>The slider selects the initial time to plot for MPM results.
</li>

<li>The check boxes select various options to the plot. Select the desired options.</li>

<li><a name="limits"></a>The limits box has three options.
<ul>
<li>Dynamic Limits: adjust limits of each frame to maximum and minimum of the frame data.</li>

<li>Global Dynamic Limits: adjust limits to global minimum and maximum of all previously
plotted data in that window. After going through all frames once, the minimum and maximum will
be the limits of all data sets.</li>

<li>Fixed Limits: Enter desired minimum and maximum in the provided fields.</li>

<li> Note: you can change limits options for the current plot. The new limits will take effect when you plot a new frame or if you click the &quot;Replot&quot; button.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Once all options are selected, click the &quot;Plot&quot; button
(or use the "Plot Results" menu command or click the &quot;Image&quot; icon)

You can resize the window to scale the plot size to the new window size.
</p>

<p>You can use slider at the bottom of the window to plot results at
different times or use the &quot;Play,&quot;
&quot;Rewind,&quot; and &quot;Pause&quot; buttons to run a movie of MPM results.</p>

<p>You can move the mouse over the plot area. As it moves, the control bar will
display the coordinates of the mouse location (x and y),
the nearest element (el), the nearest node (nd), the nearest material point (mp), and
the plotting value of the nearest material point (z)
</p>

<p><a name="exportpng"></a>The &quot;Export Graphics...&quot; command in the &quot;File&quot; menu will export the current frame to a <code>png</code> file using a name you provide. The &quot;Export Movie Frames...&quot; command will export a series of frames (starting from current) to the end of the frames (or until the pause control is clicked). The names of the exported frames will use the base name you enter and append a number (<i>e.g.</i>, 0022) for the frame index number just prior to the <code>.png</code> extension. These saved files will overwrite any files in the target folder with the same name. This naming can be read by other software (such as reading an &quot;Image Sequence&quot; into ImageJ) that can convert the frames to a movie.</p> 

<p>| <a href="#index">index</a> | <a href="#plotting">Back to Plotting Results</a> |</p>

<h2><a name="timeplot"></a>MPM Time Plots<hr></h2>

<h2><a name="meshplots"></a>Mesh Plots of MPM or FEA Results<hr></h2>

<p>First select the plotting options</p>

<ul>
<li>The first pop-up menu selects the calculation result to plot. The menu will display all
options available in the opened file.
For some results, you can select a component of that quantity
(<i>e.g.</i> the <i>xx</i> component of the stress tensor).
</li>

<li>For MPM results, the slider selects the initial time to plot.
</li>

<li>The check boxes select various options to the plot. Select the desired options.</li>

<li>The limits box works as described <a href="#limits">above</a>. Since FEA plots
only have a single frame,
the dynamic and global dynamic options are the same and you have to replot to
change any settings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once all options are selected, click the &quot;Plot&quot; button
(or use the "Plot Results" menu command or click the &quot;Image&quot;icon)
and the plot will appear in a new window.
A key to the plot colors will appear at the bottoom of the plot area. You can resize
the window to scale the plot size to the new window size.

<h2><a name="mesh2Dplots"></a>Plots Along Mesh Contours<hr></h2>

<p>First select the plotting options:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first pop-up menu selects the calculation result to plot. The menu will display
all options available in the opened file.
For some results, you can select a component of that quantity (<i>e.g.</i> the <i>xx</i>
component of the stress tensor).</li>

<li>For MPM results, the plot will be generated from results at one specific time.
Use the time slider to selected the desired time results to plot.
</li>

<li>The plot can be along any path through the mesh. You can specify a path using
the pop-up menu and select &quot;<code>x=</code>&quot; to give <code>x</code> as a
function of <code>y</code>, &quot;<code>y=</code>&quot; to give <code>y</code> as
a function of <code>x</code>, &quot;<code>D=</code>&quot; to give distance from
the origin <code>D</code> as a function of polar angle <code>T</code>, or
&quot;<code>T=</code>&quot; to give polar angle <code>T</code> as a function of distance
from the origin <code>D</code>. Select the contour option from the menu and then enter
an expression of the complementary variable in the text field. The
polar angle <code>T</code> is counter-clockwise angle from the positive <code>x</code> axis.
The resulting plot will be the selected plot quantity as a function of distance along the path.
The expression can be a constant value. A constant for an <code>x</code> contour will
be a vertical line. A constant or a <code>y</code> contour will be a horizontal line.
A constant for a <code>D</code> contour will be a circle with the entered radius.
A constant for a <code>T</code> contour will be a line from the origin at that polar angle T.
</li>

<li>The &quot;+/-&quot; field can enter a range for calculating an average plot quantity.
If it is not zero, the selected quantity will be averaged over that distance on
both sides of the path and normal to the path.</li>

<li>For crack results (<i>e.g.</i>, &quot;Crack Profile&quot;) select the crack number.
Cracks are numbered starting from 1. For crack plots, the plot will be along the crack
path and thus there is no need to select a contour (see previous step) and no need to
select a crack tip (as needed for crack tip parameters in <a href="#timeplot">time plots</a>)
</li>
</ul>

<p>Once all options are selected, click the &quot;Plot&quot; button
(or use the "Plot Results" menu command or click the &quot;Image&quot;icon)
and the plot will
appear in a new window. You can plot additional quantities on the same plot by selecting
new options (while the previous plot window is still open) and then clicking the
&quot;Add Plot&quot; button (or using the menu command or icon).

<h2><a name="viz3D"></a>Visualizing 3D MPM Results<hr></h2>

<p>This Java application cannot visualize 3D results and will report an error message when
trying to open a file containing 3D results. You can, however,
<a href="#start">run 3D calculations</a> using this tool or run 3D calculations on
a standard command line. Your options for visualizing such results are:

<ul>
<li>If you have a Macintosh, download the <b>NairnFEAMPM</b> application and open the file.
This application can do 3D particle plots of the results.
See <code>http://oregonstate.edu/~nairnj/NairnFEAMPM</code> for the download.</li>

<li>If you do not have a Mac, you can add a <code>VTKArchive</code> custom task to your
<code>NairnMPM</code> calculations to save many results as &quot;VTK Legacy&quot; files.
You can open these files in Paraview (or other tools) for 3D visualization of grid-based data.
See <code>http://www.paraview.org</code> to download Paraview.

<li>To get particle-based plots (without using a Mac), you can use the <code>ExtractMPM</code>
tool in the <code>NairnMPM</code> package to extract another type of &quot;VTK Legacy&quot;
file that Paraview can use to generate particle plots. The process in Paraview is
to add Glyphs at each particle while being sure to size the Glyphs to match the
particle size in the calculations. When editing the Glyph size, be sure to consider
the current scale factor or, alternatvely, edit the scale factor to be 1 and enter the
absolute glyph size. Box glyph edges should be 1/2 the cell length in each dimension.
Spherical glyph radii should be 1/4 the cell size.
