#ifndef _HYPERELASTIC_

#define _HYPERELASTIC_

/* When this is defined, subclasses should find (Cauchy Stress)/rho0, i.e.,
    ignore changes in density due to large deformation. The base material
    class will always return 1 for current relative volume.
   When it is not defined, subclasses should find (Kirchoff Stress)/rho0, i.e.,
    find J*(Cauchy Stress)/rho0 = (Cauchy Stress)/rho. The relative volume
    method will return J = det F = lam1*lam2*lam3
   I think when done correctly, they give the same result when converted to
    Cauchy Stress. Default is to define the constant because it is slightly
    more efficient
   Logic: GIMP development implies Cauchy stress. In finite (or uniform) GIMP
    used here, stress is multiplied by Vp0 to get shape function integral
    normalized by Vp0. In MPM this is converted to mp/rho0 to get mass-weighted
    integrals. Thus we want mass-weighted average of (Cauchy Stress)/rho0.
    Note that this might change if uniform GIMP was changed to another method.
