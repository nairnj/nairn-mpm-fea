The files in this folder set up MPM calculations using the Mac application NairnFEAMPM. This application is available for free on the Mac App store or on a separate web site at:

http://people.oregonstate.edu/~nairnj/NairnFEAMPM/index.html

The later may be more current due to delays in getting updates into the Mac App store and to potential new Apple security rules that might make applications that do interesting things no longer permitted. Apple's new thinking is that using your computer for calculations (which in NairnFEAMPM involves writing results to disk) is too risky for ordinary users. Thus power users should go the the above web site instead of the Mac App store.

Best use of these files is to:

1. Copy file to a folder outside the project download
2. Open the copied file in NairnFEAMPM
3. Change any options in the files (as documented in comments)
4. Run the calculations.

Comments at the beginning of each file define their purpose. Most of these files are basic simulations that might be useful in code development, especially when developing new materials.
